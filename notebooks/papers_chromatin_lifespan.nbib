title ={The rate of epigenetic drift scales with maximum lifespan across mammals},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-023-43417-6},
abstract ={Epigenetic drift or "disorder" increases across the mouse lifespan and is suggested to underlie epigenetic clock signals. While the role of epigenetic drift in determining maximum lifespan across species has been debated, robust tests of this hypothesis are lacking. Here, we test if epigenetic disorder at various levels of genomic resolution explains maximum lifespan across four mammal species. We show that epigenetic disorder increases with age in all species and at all levels of genomic resolution tested. The rate of disorder accumulation occurs faster in shorter lived species and corresponds to species adjusted maximum lifespan. While the density of cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides ("CpGs") is negatively associated with the rate of age-associated disorder accumulation, it does not fully explain differences across species. Our findings support the hypothesis that the rate of epigenetic drift explains maximum lifespan and provide partial support for the hypothesis that CpG density buffers against epigenetic drift.},

title ={Cohesin mediated loop extrusion from active enhancers form chromatin jets in<i>C. elegans</i>},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.09.18.558239},
abstract ={In mammals, cohesin and CTCF organize the 3D genome into topologically associated domains (TADs) to regulate communication between cis-regulatory elements. However, many organisms, including S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and A. thaliana lack CTCF. Here, we use C. elegans as a model to investigate the function of cohesin in 3D genome organization in an animal without CTCF. We use auxin-inducible degradation to acutely deplete SMC-3 or its negative regulator WAPL-1 from somatic cells. Using Hi-C data, we identify a cohesin-dependent 3D genome organization feature called chromatin jets (aka fountains). These are population average reflections of DNA loops that are ~20-40 kb in scale and often cover a few transcribed genes. The jets emerge from NIPBL occupied segments, and the trajectory of the jets coincides with cohesin binding. Cohesin translocation from jet origins depends on a fully intact complex and is extended upon WAPL-1 depletion. Hi-C results support the idea that cohesin is preferentially loaded at NIPBL occupied sites and loop extrudes in an effectively two-sided manner. The location of putative loading sites coincide with active enhancers and the strength of chromatin jet pattern correlates with transcription. Hi-C analyses upon WAPL-1 depletion reveal unequal loop extrusion processivity on each side and stalling due to cohesin molecules colliding. Compared to mammalian systems, average processivity of C. elegans cohesin is ~10-fold shorter and NIPBL binding does not depend on cohesin. We conclude that the processivity of cohesin scales with genome size; and regardless of CTCF presence, preferential loading of cohesin at enhancers is a conserved mechanism of genome organization that regulates the interaction of gene regulatory elements in 3D.},

abstract ={Aging affects nearly all aspects of our cells, from our DNA to our proteins to how our cells handle stress and communicate with each other. Age-related chromatin changes are of particular interest because chromatin can dynamically respond to the cellular and organismal environment, and many modifications at chromatin are reversible. Changes at chromatin occur during aging, and evidence from model organisms suggests that chromatin factors could play a role in modulating the aging process itself, as altering proteins that work at chromatin often affect the lifespan of yeast, worms, flies, and mice. The field of chromatin and aging is rapidly expanding, and high-resolution genomics tools make it possible to survey the chromatin environment or track chromatin factors implicated in longevity with precision that was not previously possible. In this review, we discuss the state of chromatin and aging research. We include examples from yeast, Drosophila, mice, and humans, but we particularly focus on the commonly used aging model, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, in which there are many examples of chromatin factors that modulate longevity. We include evidence of both agerelated changes to chromatin and evidence of specific chromatin factors linked to longevity in core histones, nuclear architecture, chromatin remodeling, and histone modifications.},

abstract ={Information storage and retrieval is essential for all life. In biology, information is primarily stored in two distinct ways: the genome, comprising nucleic acids, acts as a foundational blueprint and the epigenome, consisting of chemical modifications to DNA and histone proteins, regulates gene expression patterns and endows cells with specific identities and functions. Unlike the stable, digital nature of genetic information, epigenetic information is stored in a digital-analog format, susceptible to alterations induced by diverse environmental signals and cellular damage. The Information Theory of Aging (ITOA) states that the aging process is driven by the progressive loss of youthful epigenetic information, the retrieval of which via epigenetic reprogramming can improve the function of damaged and aged tissues by catalyzing age reversal.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1093/g3journal/jkad265},
abstract ={Stress preconditioning occurs when transient, sublethal stress events impact an organism's ability to counter future stresses. Although preconditioning effects are often noted in the literature, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms. To model preconditioning, we exposed a panel of genetically diverse Drosophila melanogaster to a sublethal heat shock and measured how well the flies survived subsequent exposure to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The impact of preconditioning varied with genetic background, ranging from dying half as fast to 4 and a half times faster with preconditioning compared to no preconditioning. Subsequent association and transcriptional analyses revealed that histone methylation, and transcriptional regulation are both candidate preconditioning modifier pathways. Strikingly, almost all subunits (7/8) in the Set1/COMPASS complex were identified as candidate modifiers of preconditioning. Functional analysis of Set1 knockdown flies demonstrated that loss of Set1 led to the transcriptional dysregulation of canonical ER stress genes during preconditioning. Based on these analyses, we propose a preconditioning model in which Set1 helps to establish an interim transcriptional "memory" of previous stress events, resulting in a preconditioned response to subsequent stress.},

year ={2024},
doi ={10.3389/fragi.2024.1380016},
abstract ={The gonad has become a central organ for understanding aging in C. elegans, as removing the proliferating stem cells in the germline results in significant lifespan extension. Similarly, when starvation in late larval stages leads to the quiescence of germline stem cells the adult nematode enters reproductive diapause, associated with an extended lifespan. This review summarizes recent advancements in identifying the mechanisms behind gonad-mediated lifespan extension, including comparisons with other nematodes and the role of lipid signaling and transcriptional changes. Given that the gonad also mediates lifespan regulation in other invertebrates and vertebrates, elucidating the underlying mechanisms may help to gain new insights into the mechanisms and evolution of aging.},

year ={2024},
doi ={10.1186/s13072-024-00547-5},
abstract ={Regenerative potential is governed by a complex process of transcriptional reprogramming, involving chromatin reorganization and dynamics in transcription factor binding patterns throughout the genome. The degree to which chromatin and epigenetic changes contribute to this process remains only partially understood. Here we provide a modified CUT&Tag protocol suitable for improved characterization and interrogation of changes in chromatin modifications during adult fin regeneration in zebrafish. Our protocol generates data that recapitulates results from previously published ChIP-Seq methods, requires far fewer cells as input, and significantly improves signal to noise ratios. We deliver high-resolution enrichment maps for H3K4me3 of uninjured and regenerating fin tissues. During regeneration, we find that H3K4me3 levels increase over gene promoters which become transcriptionally active and genes which lose H3K4me3 become silenced. Interestingly, these reprogramming events recapitulate the H3K4me3 patterns observed in developing fin folds of 24-h old zebrafish embryos. Our results indicate that changes in genomic H3K4me3 patterns during fin regeneration occur in a manner consistent with reactivation of developmental programs, demonstrating CUT&Tag to be an effective tool for profiling chromatin landscapes in regenerating tissues.},

abstract ={Metabolic and epigenetic rewiring are widely considered hallmarks of cancer, with emerging evidence of crosstalk between them. Anecdotal evidence of metabolic enzymes moonlighting in the chromatin environment has suggested how this crosstalk might be facilitated, but the extent of nuclear relocalization of metabolic enzymes remains elusive. Here, we provide a comprehensive chromatin proteomics resource across cancer lineages as well as healthy samples and demonstrate that metabolic enzyme moonlighting on chromatin is widespread across tissues and pathways. We show that the abundance of metabolic enzymes on chromatin is tissue-specific, with oxidative phosphorylation proteins depleted in lung cancer samples, perhaps suggesting an interplay between cell identity and nuclear metabolism. Finally, we explore metabolic functions in the chromatin environment and show that one-carbon folate enzymes are associated with DNA damage and repair processes, providing an approach to explore non-canonical functions of metabolic enzymes.},

doi ={10.1038/s41586-023-06585-5},
abstract ={Postnatal maturation of cardiomyocytes is characterized by a metabolic switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation, chromatin reconfiguration and exit from the cell cycle, instating a barrier for adult heart regeneration 1,2. Here, to explore whether metabolic reprogramming can overcome this barrier and enable heart regeneration, we abrogate fatty acid oxidation in cardiomyocytes by inactivation of Cpt1b. We find that disablement of fatty acid oxidation in cardiomyocytes improves resistance to hypoxia and stimulates cardiomyocyte proliferation, allowing heart regeneration after ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Metabolic studies reveal profound changes in energy metabolism and accumulation of Œ±-ketoglutarate in Cpt1b-mutant cardiomyocytes, leading to activation of the Œ±-ketoglutarate-dependent lysine demethylase KDM5 (ref. 3). Activated KDM5 demethylates broad H3K4me3 domains in genes that drive cardiomyocyte maturation, lowering their transcription levels and shifting cardiomyocytes into a less mature state, thereby promoting proliferation. We conclude that metabolic maturation shapes the epigenetic landscape of cardiomyocytes, creating a roadblock for further cell divisions. Reversal of this process allows repair of damaged hearts.},
