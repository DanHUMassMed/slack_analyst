year ={2023},
doi ={10.1083/jcb.202304026},
abstract ={Lipid composition determines organelle identity; however, whether the lipid composition of the inner nuclear membrane (INM) domain of the ER contributes to its identity is not known. Here, we show that the INM lipid environment of animal cells is under local control by CTDNEP1, the master regulator of the phosphatidic acid phosphatase lipin 1. Loss of CTDNEP1 reduces association of an INM-specific diacylglycerol (DAG) biosensor and results in a decreased percentage of polyunsaturated containing DAG species. Alterations in DAG metabolism impact the levels of the resident INM protein Sun2, which is under local proteasomal regulation. We identify a lipid-binding amphipathic helix (AH) in the nucleoplasmic domain of Sun2 that prefers membrane packing defects. INM dissociation of the Sun2 AH is linked to its proteasomal degradation. We suggest that direct lipid-protein interactions contribute to sculpting the INM proteome and that INM identity is adaptable to lipid metabolism, which has broad implications on disease mechanisms associated with the nuclear envelope. .},

year ={2019},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.46595.001},
abstract ={The unfolded protein response (UPR) detects and restores deficits in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding capacity. Ceapins specifically inhibit the UPR sensor ATF6a, an ERtethered transcription factor, by retaining it at the ER through an unknown mechanism. Our genome-wide CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen reveals that Ceapins function is completely dependent on the ABCD3 peroxisomal transporter. Proteomics studies establish that ABCD3 physically associates with ER-resident ATF6a in cells and in vitro in a Ceapin-dependent manner. Ceapins induce the neomorphic association of ER and peroxisomes by directly tethering the cytosolic domain of ATF6a to ABCD3's transmembrane regions without inhibiting or depending on ABCD3 transporter activity. Thus, our studies reveal that Ceapins function by chemical-induced misdirection which explains their remarkable specificity and opens up new mechanistic routes for drug development and synthetic biology.},

abstract ={Phosphatidylcholine, the major phospholipid of very low density lipoproteins, is packaged with triglyceride in the Golgi cisternae. CTP-phosphocholine cytidyltransferase and CDP-choline phosphotransferase activities of Golgi subfractions were higher than those of rough or smooth microsomes measured under the same conditions, indicating that phosphatidylcholine synthesis can occur in Golgi membranes. Consistent with this, the specific activity of phosphatidylcholine of Golgi membranes rose more rapidly than that of rough and smooth microsomes after injection of ["C]choline in vivo. The specific activity of the Golgi content phosphatidylcholine (nonmembrane fraction) remained low. The S-adenosylmethionine phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase activity of Golgi subfractions was also higher than that of rough or smooth microsomes. After injection of ['H]methyl-labeled methionine in vivo, the specific activity of phosphatidylcholine of the Golgi membranes rose in parallel with that of the rough and smooth microsomes. The specific activity of the Golgi content phosphatidylcholine rose above that of the Golgi membranes and exhibited a different pattern, suggesting that this pathway may selectively label phosphatidylcholine which is secreted as lipoproteins. 8 These observations indicate that the Golgi membranes have the enzymes necessary for synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, and incorporation of lipid precursors indicates that synthesis of phosphatidylcholine by Golgi membranes occurs in vivo.-Higgins, J.

title ={ADP-ribosylation factor and phosphatidic acid levels in Golgi membranes during budding of coatomer-coated vesicles},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={The finding that ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) can activate phospholipase D has led to debate as to whether ARF recruits coat proteins through direct binding or indirectly by catalytically increasing phosphatidic acid production. Here we test critical aspects of these hypotheses. We find that Golgi membrane phosphatidic acid levels do not rise-in fact they decline-during cell-free budding reactions. We confirm that the level of membrane-bound ARF can be substantially reduced without compromising coat assembly [Ktistakis, N. T., Brown, H. A., Waters, M. G., Sternweis, P. C. & Roth, M. G. (1996) J. Cell Biol. 134, 295-306], but find that under all conditions, ARF is present on the Golgi membrane in molar excess over bound coatomer. These results do not support the possibility that the activation of coat assembly by ARF is purely catalytic, and they are consistent with ARF forming direct interactions with coatomer. We suggest that ARF, like many other G proteins, is a multifunctional protein with roles in trafficking and phospholipid signaling.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1016/j.neuron.2022.04.020},
abstract ={The defining evolutionary feature of eukaryotic cells is the emergence of membrane-bound organelles. Compartmentalization allows each organelle to maintain a spatially, physically, and chemically distinct environment, which greatly bolsters individual organelle function. However, the activities of each organelle must be balanced and are interdependent for cellular homeostasis. Therefore, properly regulated interactions between organelles, either physically or functionally, remain critical for overall cellular health and behavior. In particular, neuronal homeostasis depends heavily on the proper regulation of organelle function and cross talk, and deficits in these functions are frequently associated with diseases. In this review, we examine the emerging role of organelle contacts in neurological diseases and discuss how the disruption of contacts contributes to disease pathogenesis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and regulation of organelle contacts will broaden our knowledge of their role in health and disease, laying the groundwork for the development of new therapies targeting interorganelle cross talk and function.},

title ={Rhomboid protease RHBDL4/RHBDD1 cleaves SREBP-1c at endoplasmic reticulum monitoring and regulating fatty acids},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad351},
abstract ={The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-embedded transcription factors, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), master regulators of lipid biosynthesis, are transported to the Golgi for proteolytic activation to tune cellular cholesterol levels and regulate lipogenesis. However, mechanisms by which the cell responds to the levels of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids remain underexplored. Here, we show that RHBDL4/RHBDD1, a rhomboid family protease, directly cleaves SREBP-1c at the ER. The p97/VCP, AAA-ATPase complex then acts as an auxiliary segregase to extract the remaining ER-embedded fragment of SREBP-1c. Importantly, the enzymatic activity of RHBDL4 is enhanced by saturated fatty acids (SFAs) but inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Genetic deletion of RHBDL4 in mice fed on a Western diet enriched in SFAs and cholesterol prevented SREBP-1c from inducing genes for lipogenesis, particularly for synthesis and incorporation of PUFAs, and secretion of lipoproteins. The RHBDL4-SREBP-1c pathway reveals a regulatory system for monitoring fatty acid composition and maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis.},

title ={Several ADP-ribosylation Factor (Arf) Isoforms Support COPI Vesicle Formation},
year ={2011},
doi ={10.1074/jbc.M111.261800},
abstract ={Newly synthesized proteins and lipids are transported in vesicular carriers along the secretory pathway. Arfs (ADP-ribosylation factors), a family of highly conserved GTPases within the Ras superfamily, control recruitment of molecular coats to membranes, the initial step of coated vesicle biogenesis. Arf1 and coatomer constitute the minimal cytosolic machinery leading to COPI vesicle formation from Golgi membranes. Although some functional redundancies have been suggested, other Arf isoforms have been poorly analyzed in this context. In this study, we found that Arf1, Arf4, and Arf5, but not Arf3 and Arf6, associate with COPI vesicles generated in vitro from Golgi membranes and purified cytosol. Using recombinant myristoylated proteins, we show that Arf1, Arf4, and Arf5 each support COPI vesicle formation individually. Unexpectedly, we found that Arf3 could also mediate vesicle biogenesis. However, Arf3 was excluded from the vesicle fraction in the presence of the other isoforms, highlighting a functional competition between the different Arf members.},

title ={Origin of gradients in lipid density and surface tension between connected lipid droplet and bilayer},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1016/j.bpj.2021.11.022},
abstract ={We combined theory and experiments to depict physical parameters modulating the phospholipid (PL) density and tension equilibrium between a bilayer and an oil droplet in contiguity. This situation is encountered during a neutral lipid (NL) droplet formation in the endoplasmic reticulum. We set up macroscopic and microscopic models to uncover free parameters and the origin of molecular interactions controlling the PL densities of the droplet monolayer and the bilayer. The established physical laws and predictions agreed with experiments performed with droplet-embedded vesicles. We found that the droplet monolayer is always by a few percent ($10%) less packed with PLs than the bilayer. Such a density gradient arises from PL-NL interactions on the droplet, which are lower than PL-PL trans interactions in the bilayer, i.e., interactions between PLs belonging to different leaflets of the bilayer. Finally, despite the pseudo-surface tension for the water/PL acyl chains in the bilayer being higher than the water/NL surface tension, the droplet monolayer always has a higher surface tension than the bilayer because of its lower PL density. Thus, a PL density gradient is mandatory to maintain the mechanical and thermodynamic equilibrium of the droplet-bilayer continuity. Our study sheds light on the origin of the molecular interactions responsible for the unique surface properties of lipid droplets compared with cellular bilayer membranes.},

doi ={10.1038/s41467-022-28469-4},
abstract ={As a major risk factor to human health, obesity presents a massive burden to people and society. Interestingly, the obese status of parents can cause progeny's lipid accumulation through epigenetic inheritance in multiple species. To date, many questions remain as to how lipid accumulation leads to signals that are transmitted across generations. In this study, we establish a nematode model of C. elegans raised on a high-fat diet (HFD) that leads to measurable lipid accumulation, which can transmit the lipid accumulation signal to their multigenerational progeny. Using this model, we find that transcription factors DAF-16/ FOXO and SBP-1/SREBP, nuclear receptors NHR-49 and NHR-80, and delta-9 desaturases (fat-5, fat-6, and fat-7) are required for transgenerational lipid accumulation. Additionally, histone H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks lipid metabolism genes and increases their transcription response to multigenerational obesogenic effects. In summary, this study establishes an interaction between a network of lipid metabolic genes and chromatin modifications, which work together to achieve transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of obesogenic effects.},

doi ={10.1091/mbc.E23-07-0283)},
abstract ={Arf GTPases are central regulators of the Golgi complex, which serves as the nexus of membrane-trafficking pathways in eukaryotic cells. Arf proteins recruit dozens of effectors to modify membranes, sort cargos, and create and tether transport vesicles, and are therefore essential for orchestrating Golgi trafficking. The regulation of Arf activity is controlled by the action of Arf-GEFs which activate via nucleotide exchange, and Arf-GAPs which inactivate via nucleotide hydrolysis. The localization dynamics of Arf GTPases and their Arf-GAPs during Golgi maturation have not been reported. Here we use the budding yeast model to examine the temporal localization of the Golgi Arf-GAPs. We also determine the mechanisms used by the Arf-GAP Age2 to localize to the Golgi. We find that the catalytic activity of Age2 and a conserved sequence in the unstructured C-terminal domain of Age2 are both required for Golgi localization. This sequence is predicted to form an amphipathic helix and mediates direct binding of Age2 to membranes in vitro. We also report the development of a probe for sensing active Arf1 in living cells and use this probe to characterize the temporal dynamics of Arf1 during Golgi maturation.},

year ={2005},
doi ={10.1091/mbc.E04},
abstract ={The ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) are six proteins within the larger Arf family and Ras superfamily that regulate membrane traffic. Arfs all share numerous biochemical activities and have very similar specific activities. The use of dominant mutants and brefeldin A has been important to the discovery of the cellular functions of Arfs but lack specificity between Arf isoforms. We developed small interference RNA constructs capable of specific depletion of each of the cytoplasmic human Arfs to examine the specificity of Arfs in live cells. No single Arf was required for any step of membrane traffic examined in HeLa cells. However, every combination of the double knockdowns of Arf1, Arf3, Arf4, and Arf5 yielded a distinct pattern of defects in secretory and endocytic traffic, demonstrating clear specificity for Arfs at multiple steps. These results suggest that the cooperation of two Arfs at the same site may be a general feature of Arf signaling and provide candidates at several cellular locations that when paired with data on the localization of the many different Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factors, Arf GTPase activating proteins, and effectors will aid in the description of the mechanisms of specificity in this highly conserved and primordial family of regulatory GTPases.},

abstract ={How can anterograde membrane trafficking be modulated by physiological cues? A screen of Golgi-associated proteins revealed that the ARF-GEF GBF1 can selectively modulate the ER-Golgi trafficking of prohaemostatic von Willebrand factor (VWF) and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in human endothelial cells and in mouse fibroblasts. The relationship between levels of GBF1 and the trafficking of VWF into forming secretory granules confirmed GBF1 is a limiting factor in this process. Further, GBF1 activation by AMPK couples its control of anterograde trafficking to physiological cues; levels of glucose control GBF1 activation in turn modulating VWF trafficking into secretory granules. GBF1 modulates both ER and TGN exit, the latter dramatically affecting the size of the VWF storage organelles, thereby influencing the hemostatic capacity of the endothelium. The role of AMPK as a central integrating element of cellular pathways with intra-and extra-cellular cues can now be extended to modulation of the anterograde secretory pathway.},

abstract ={Lipid and carbohydrate metabolism are highly conserved processes that affect nearly all aspects of organismal biology. Caenorhabditis elegans eat bacteria, which consist of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins that are broken down during digestion into fatty acids, simple sugars, and amino acid precursors. With these nutrients, C. elegans synthesizes a wide range of metabolites that are required for development and behavior. In this review, we outline lipid and carbohydrate structures as well as biosynthesis and breakdown pathways that have been characterized in C. elegans. We bring attention to functional studies using mutant strains that reveal physiological roles for specific lipids and carbohydrates during development, aging, and adaptation to changing environmental conditions.},

doi ={10.1371/journal.pbio.3001051},
abstract ={Coordination of cell growth is essential for the development of the brain, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of glial and neuronal size are poorly understood. To investigate the mechanisms involved in glial size regulation, we used Caenorhabditis elegans amphid sheath (AMsh) glia as a model and show that a conserved cis-Golgi membrane protein eas-1/GOLT1B negatively regulates glial growth. We found that eas-1 inhibits a conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase rnf-145/RNF145, which, in turn, promotes nuclear activation of sbp-1/ SREBP, a key regulator of sterol and fatty acid synthesis, to restrict cell growth. At early developmental stages, rnf-145 in the cis-Golgi network inhibits sbp-1 activation to promote the growth of glia, and when animals reach the adult stage, this inhibition is released through an eas-1-dependent shuttling of rnf-145 from the cis-Golgi to the trans-Golgi network to stop glial growth. Furthermore, we identified long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as downstream products of the eas-1-rnf-145-sbp-1 pathway that functions to prevent the overgrowth of glia. Together, our findings reveal a novel and potentially conserved mechanism underlying glial size control.},

abstract ={In vitro experiments have shown that GRASP65 (GORASP1) and GRASP55 (GORASP2) proteins function in stacking Golgi cisternae. However, in vivo depletion of GORASPs in metazoans has given equivocal results. We have generated a mouse lacking both GORASPs and find that Golgi cisternae remained stacked. However, the stacks are disconnected laterally from each other, and the cisternal cross-sectional diameters are significantly reduced compared with their normal counterparts. These data support earlier findings on the role of GORASPs in linking stacks, and we suggest that unlinking of stacks likely affects dynamic control of COPI budding and vesicle fusion at the rims. The net result is that cisternal cores remain stacked, but cisternal diameter is reduced by rim consumption. .},

title ={An SPNS1-dependent lysosomal lipid transport pathway that enables cell survival under choline limitation},

doi ={},
abstract ={Lysosomes degrade macromolecules and recycle their nutrient content to support cell function and survival. However, the machineries involved in lysosomal recycling of many nutrients remain to be discovered, with a notable example being choline, an essential metabolite liberated via lipid degradation. Here, we engineered metabolic dependency on lysosome-derived choline in pancreatic cancer cells to perform an endolysosomefocused CRISPR-Cas9 screen for genes mediating lysosomal choline recycling. We identified the orphan lysosomal transmembrane protein SPNS1 as critical for cell survival under choline limitation. SPNS1 loss leads to intralysosomal accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE). Mechanistically, we reveal that SPNS1 is a proton gradient-dependent transporter of LPC species from the lysosome for their re-esterification into phosphatidylcholine in the cytosol. Last, we establish that LPC efflux by SPNS1 is required for cell survival under choline limitation. Collectively, our work defines a lysosomal phospholipid salvage pathway that is essential under nutrient limitation and, more broadly, provides a robust platform to deorphan lysosomal gene function.},

title ={Site-specific phosphorylations of the Arf activator GBF1 differentially regulate GBF1 function in Golgi homeostasis and secretion versus cytokinesis},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1038/s41598-023-40705-5},
abstract ={Diverse cellular processes, including membrane traffic, lipid homeostasis, cytokinesis, mitochondrial positioning, and cell motility are critically dependent on the Sec7 domain guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1. Yet, how the participation of GBF1 in a particular cellular function is regulated is unknown. Here, we show that the phosphorylation of specific highly conserved serine and tyrosine residues within the N-terminal domain of GBF1 differentially regulates its function in maintaining Golgi homeostasis and facilitating secretion versus its role in cytokinesis. Specifically, GBF1 mutants containing single amino acid substitutions that mimic a stably phosphorylated S233, S371, Y377, and Y515 or the S233A mutant that can't be phosphorylated are fully able to maintain Golgi architecture and support cargo traffic through the secretory pathway when assessed in multiple functional assays. However, the same mutants cause multi-nucleation when expressed in cells, and appear to inhibit the progression through mitosis and the resolution of cytokinetic bridges. Thus, GBF1 participates in distinct interactive networks when mediating Golgi homeostasis and secretion versus facilitating cytokinesis, and GBF1 integration into such networks is differentially regulated by the phosphorylation of specific GBF1 residues. Cellular homeostasis depends on tightly controlled circuits that engage and coordinate different processes in response to internal and external cues. The integration of cellular metabolic, genetic, and physiological/biochemical state is continuously monitored and relayed to each other for system-wide synchronization. Distinct checkpoints and control mechanisms have evolved to ensure that processes are coordinated in time and space. The secretory pathway, composed of a number of distinct compartments, is tightly regulated to ensure a compensatory anterograde and recycling traffic of membrane and select proteins to ensure continuous transport. One of the key regulators of the secretory pathway are the small GTPases of the Arf superfamily that facilitate traffic at the ER-Golgi interface 1-5. Arfs are essential to recruit the heptameric coatomer coat complexes to Golgi membranes to form COPI vesicles that recycle proteins and membrane from the Golgi to the ER 6-9. All Arfs cycle between GDP-and GTP-bound states and are functional and membrane-associated only when in their GTP-bound (active) state 10. The GDP/GTP exchange is kinetically unfavorable (to prevent spurious Arf activation) and requires an enzyme, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to catalyze the displacement of the GDP, thus allowing the binding of the activating GTP to the Arf. The GEF responsible for COPI vesicle formation is the Golgi-Specific Brefeldin A Resistance Factor 1 (GBF1), which localizes to the compartments at the ER-Golgi interface, including ER exit sites, ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC) and the Golgi 11,12. GBF1 is absolutely essential to activate Arfs required to maintain the architecture and function of the secretory pathway, and the disruption of GBF1 activity with the Brefeldin A (BFA) fungal metabolite or the depletion of cellular GBF1 by RNAi causes Golgi collapse into the ER and inhibits secretion 11,13-16 .},

While Golgi structure is important for the efficient processing of secretory cargo, the unusual organization suggests additional potential functions. The Golgi is disassembled after various cellular stresses, and we hypothesize that Golgi disassembly activates a stress signaling pathway. This pathway would function to correct the stress if possible, with irreparable stress resulting in apoptosis. Neurons appear to be particularly sensitive to Golgi stress; early disassembly of the organelle correlates with many neurodegenerative diseases. Here, Golgi stress and potential signaling pathways to the nucleus are reviewed.},

title ={Anionic phospholipids determine G protein coupling selectivity at distinct subcellular membrane compartments},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.08.31.555797},
abstract ={G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activate different signaling pathways through coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins consisting of four types of G alpha (Gα) subunits and the beta gamma (bg) subunits. The C-terminal regions of Gα proteins is thought to determine coupling selectivity. However, there are several reports indicating that some receptors are promiscuous and can couple to multiple Gα proteins. The precise mechanism promoting promiscuous coupling is not fully understood. Here we show that anionic phospholipids such as phosphoinositide 4,5 bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) promote electrostatic interactions between anionic lipid head groups and positively charged amino acids in the transmembrane 4 (TM4) region of beta adrenergic receptors (βARs) to prime receptor coupling to the cognate Gαs and non-cognate Gαi proteins. The promiscuous coupling can only occur at the plasma membrane, a membrane compartment enriched in PI(4,5)P2, while receptors only couple to cognate Gαs proteins in compartments that are enriched in less negatively charged phosphoinositides such PI4P at the Golgi membranes. We took advantage of the rapamycin dimerization system to rapidly and inducibly deplete PI(4,5)P2 by recruiting a phosphatase to the plasma membrane and found that in the absence of anionic phospholipids, βARs couple only to their cognate Gαs protein. Finally, we found that mutating βARs PI(4,5)P2 binding motifs or depleting PI(4,5)P2 results in enhanced βARs-mediated cAMP response. Together, these findings reveal a role for anionic phosphoinositides in regulating GPCR activity at different subcellular compartments.},

doi ={10.1091/mbc.E08},
abstract ={Despite extensive work on ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) 1 at the Golgi complex, the functions of Arf2-5 in the secretory pathway, or for that of any Arf at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) remain uncharacterized. Here, we examined the recruitment of fluorescently tagged Arf1,-3,-4, and-5 onto peripheral ERGIC. Live cell imaging detected Arfs on peripheral puncta that also contained Golgi-specific brefeldin A (BFA) resistance factor (GBF) 1 and the ERGIC marker p58. Unexpectedly, BFA did not promote corecruitment of Arfs with GBF1 either at the Golgi complex or the ERGIC, but it uncovered striking differences between Arf1,3 and Arf4,5. Although Arf1,3 quickly dissociated from all endomembranes after BFA addition, Arf4,5 persisted on ERGIC structures, even after redistribution of GBF1 to separate compartments. The GDP-arrested Arf4(T31N) mutant localized to the ERGIC, even with BFA and Exo1 present. In addtion, loss of Arf ⅐ GTP after treatment with Exo1 caused rapid release of all Arfs from the Golgi complex and led to GBF1 accumulation on both Golgi and ERGIC membranes. Our results demonstrate that GDP-bound Arf4,5 associate with ERGIC membranes through binding sites distinct from those responsible for GBF1 recruitment. Furthermore, they provide the first evidence that GBF1 accumulation on membranes may be caused by loss of Arf ⅐ GTP, rather than the formation of an Arf ⅐ GDP ⅐ BFA ⅐ GBF1 complex.},

Global profiling of fatty acylated proteins via click chemistry further revealed acylation specificity at the individual protein level.

abstract ={In research on cell biology, organelles have been a major unit of such analyses. Researchers have assumed that the inside of an organelle is almost uniform in regards to its function, even though each organelle has multiple functions. However, we are now facing conundrums that cannot be resolved so long as we regard organelles as functionally uniform units. For instance, how can cells control the diverse patterns of glycosylation of various secretory proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi in an orderly manner with high accuracy? Here, we introduce the novel concept of organelle zones as a solution; each organelle has functionally distinct zones, and zones in different organelles closely interact each other in order to perform complex cellular functions. This Copernican Revolution from organelle biology to organelle zone biology will drastically change and advance our thoughts about cells.},

title ={An antisteatosis response regulated by oleic acid through lipid droplet-mediated ERAD enhancement},
year ={2024},
doi ={},
abstract ={Although excessive lipid accumulation is a hallmark of obesity-related pathologies, some lipids are beneficial. Oleic acid (OA), the most abundant monounsaturated fatty acid (FA), promotes health and longevity. Here, we show that OA benefits Caenorhabditis elegans by activating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transcription factor SKN-1A (Nrf1/NFE2L1) in a lipid homeostasis response. SKN-1A/Nrf1 is cleared from the ER by the ERassociated degradation (ERAD) machinery and stabilized when proteasome activity is low and canonically maintains proteasome homeostasis. Unexpectedly, OA increases nuclear SKN-1A levels independently of proteasome activity, through lipid droplet-dependent enhancement of ERAD. In turn, SKN-1A reduces steatosis by reshaping the lipid metabolism transcriptome and mediates longevity from OA provided through endogenous accumulation, reduced H3K4 trimethylation, or dietary supplementation. Our findings reveal an unexpected mechanism of FA signal transduction, as well as a lipid homeostasis pathway that provides strategies for opposing steatosis and aging, and may mediate some benefits of the OA-rich Mediterranean diet.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1091/mbc.E21-02-0069},
abstract ={Proper Golgi complex function depends on the activity of Arf1, a GTPase whose effectors assemble and transport outgoing vesicles. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) generated at the Golgi by the conserved PI 4-kinase Pik1 (PI4KIIIβ) is also essential for Golgi function, although its precise roles in vesicle formation are less clear. Arf1 has been reported to regulate PI4P production, but whether Pik1 is a direct Arf1 effector is not established. Using a combination of live-cell time-lapse imaging analyses, acute PI4P depletion experiments, and in vitro protein-protein interaction assays on Golgi-mimetic membranes, we present evidence for a model in which Arf1 initiates the final stages of Golgi maturation by tightly controlling PI4P production through direct recruitment of the Pik1-Frq1 PI4-kinase complex. This PI4P serves as a critical signal for AP-1 and secretory vesicle formation, the final events at maturing Golgi compartments. This work therefore establishes the regulatory and temporal context surrounding Golgi PI4P production and its precise roles in Golgi maturation.},

doi ={10.1038/s41598-022-05340-6},
abstract ={Challenges from environmental stressors have a profound impact on many life-history traits of an organism, including reproductive strategy. Examples across multiple taxa have demonstrated that maternal reproductive investment resulting from stress can improve offspring survival; a form of matricidal provisioning when death appears imminent is known as terminal investment. Here we report a reproductive response in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans upon exposure to acute cold shock at 2 °C, whereby vitellogenic lipid movement from the soma to the germline appears to be massively upregulated at the expense of parental survival. This response is dependent on functional TAX-2; TAX-4 cGMP-gated channels that are part of canonical thermosensory mechanisms in worms and can be prevented in the presence of activated SKN-1/Nrf2, the master stress regulator. Increased maternal provisioning promotes improved embryonic cold shock survival, which is notably suppressed in animals with impaired vitellogenesis. These findings suggest that cold shock in C. elegans triggers terminal investment to promote progeny fitness at the expense of parental survival and may serve as a tractable model for future studies of stress-induced progeny plasticity.},

abstract ={The realization that the meticulous organization of cellular organelles is not required for the reconstitution of select intracellular traffic steps has revolutionized cell biology. It transformed the discipline from a morphological one into a molecular one. It helped in defining the activities of COPII and COPI vesicle coats in secretion. The work established the principles of the vesicular traffic model as envisioned by George Palade 50 years ago. However, in recent years, numerous advances in cellular and imaging technologies afforded an unprecedented molecular resolution that sheds new light on COPII activities and biosynthetic traffic between the ER and the Golgi. In the following review, I summarize this new information and attempt to provide a unified physical-molecular-morphological description of this traffic step. This information expands on the simplistic principles of vesicular traffic and provides novel frameworks to examine and explain physiological secretion.},

Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy offers the required spatial resolution but struggles to reveal more than four different targets simultaneously. Exchanging labels in subsequent imaging rounds for multiplexed imaging extends this number but is limited by its low throughput. Here we present a novel imaging method for rapid multiplexed super-resolution microscopy of a nearly unlimited number of molecular targets by leveraging fluorogenic labeling in conjunction with Transient Adapter-mediated switching for high-throughput DNA-PAINT (FLASH-PAINT). We demonstrate the cell biological versatility of FLASH-PAINT in mammalian cells in four applications: i) mapping nine proteins in a single mammalian cell, ii) elucidating the functional organization of primary cilia by nine-target imaging, iii) revealing the changes in proximity of twelve different targets in unperturbed and dissociated Golgi stacks and iv) investigating inter-organelle contacts at 3D super-resolution.},

abstract ={It is well-known that aqueous dispersions of phospholipids spontaneously assemble into bilayer structures. These structures have numerous applications across chemistry and materials science and form the fundamental structural unit of the biological membrane. The particular environment of the lipid bilayer, with a water-poor low dielectric core surrounded by a more polar and better hydrated interfacial region, gives the membrane particular biophysical and physicochemical properties and presents a unique environment for chemical reactions to occur. Many different types of molecule spanning a range of sizes, from dissolved gases through small organics to proteins, are able to interact with membranes and promote chemical changes to lipids that subsequently affect the physicochemical properties of the bilayer. This Review describes the chemical reactivity exhibited by lipids in their membrane form, with an emphasis on conditions where the lipids are well hydrated in the form of bilayers. Key topics include the following: lytic reactions of glyceryl esters, including hydrolysis, aminolysis, and transesterification; oxidation reactions of alkenes in unsaturated fatty acids and sterols, including autoxidation and oxidation by singlet oxygen; reactivity of headgroups, particularly with reactive carbonyl species; and E/Z isomerization of alkenes. The consequences of reactivity for biological activity and biophysical properties are also discussed. CONTENTS},

abstract ={Proteins essential for vesicle formation by the Coat Protein I (COPI) complex are being identified, but less is known about the role of specific lipids. Brefeldin-A ADP-ribosylated substrate (BARS) functions in the fission step of COPI vesicle formation. Here, we show that BARS induces membrane curvature in cooperation with phosphatidic acid. This finding has allowed us to further delineate COPI vesicle fission into two sub-stages: 1) an earlier stage of bud-neck constriction, in which BARS and other COPI components are required, and 2) a later stage of bud-neck scission, in which phosphatidic acid generated by phospholipase D2 (PLD2) is also required. Moreover, in contrast to the disruption of the Golgi seen on perturbing the core COPI components (such as coatomer), inhibition of PLD2 causes milder disruptions, suggesting that such COPI components have additional roles in maintaining Golgi structure other than through COPI vesicle formation.},

abstract ={Mutation of C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontal temporal degeneration (FTD), which is attributed to both a gain and loss of function. C9orf72 forms a complex with SMCR8 and WDR41, which was reported to have GTPase activating protein activity toward ARF proteins, RAB8A, and RAB11A. We determined the cryo-EM structure of ARF1-GDP-BeF 3-bound to C9orf72:SMCR8:WDR41. The SMCR8 longin and C9orf72 longin domains form the binding pocket for ARF1. One face of the C9orf72 longin domain holds ARF1 in place, while the SMCR8 longin positions the catalytic finger Arg147 in the ARF1 active site. Mutations in interfacial residues of ARF1 and C9orf72 reduced or eliminated GAP activity. RAB8A GAP required ~10-fold higher concentrations of the C9orf72 complex than for ARF1. These data support a specific function for the C9orf72 complex as an ARF GAP. The structure also provides a model for the active forms of the longin domain GAPs of FLCN and NPRL2 that regulate the Rag GTPases of the mTORC1 pathway.},

year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine are the most abundant phospholipids in eukaryotic cells and thus have major roles in the formation and maintenance of vesicular membranes. In yeast, diacylglycerol accepts a phosphocholine moiety through a CPT1-derived cholinephosphotransferase activity to directly synthesize phosphatidylcholine. EPT1-derived activity can transfer either phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine to diacylglcyerol in vitro, but is currently believed to primarily synthesize phosphatidylethanolamine in vivo. In this study we report that CPT1-and EPT1-derived cholinephosphotransferase activities can significantly overlap in vivo such that EPT1 can contribute to 60% of net phosphatidylcholine synthesis via the Kennedy pathway. Alterations in the level of diacylglycerol consumption through alterations in phosphatidylcholine synthesis directly correlated with the level of SEC14-dependent invertase secretion and affected cell viability. Administration of synthetic di8:0 diacylglycerol resulted in a partial rescue of cells from SEC14-mediated cell death. The addition of di8:0 diacylglycerol increased di8:0 diacylglycerol levels 20-40-fold over endogenous long-chain diacylglycerol levels. Di8:0 diacylglcyerol did not alter endogenous phospholipid metabolic pathways, nor was it converted to di8:0 phosphatidic acid.},

abstract ={The mammalian Golgi comprises tightly adjacent and flattened membrane sacs called cisternae. We still do not understand the molecular organization of the Golgi and intra-Golgi transport of cargos. One of the most significant challenges to studying the Golgi is resolving Golgi proteins at the cisternal level under light microscopy. We have developed a side-averaging approach to visualize the cisternal organization and intra-Golgi transport in nocodazole-induced Golgi ministacks. Side-view images of ministacks acquired from Airyscan microscopy are transformed and aligned before intensity normalization and averaging. From side-average images of >30 Golgi proteins, we uncovered the organization of the pre-Golgi, cis, medial, trans, and trans-Golgi network membrane with an unprecedented spatial resolution. We observed the progressive transition of a synchronized cargo wave from the cis to the trans-side of the Golgi. Our data support our previous finding, in which constitutive cargos exit at the trans-Golgi while the secretory targeting to the trans-Golgi network is signal dependent. .},

doi ={10.1038/s41467-022-30060-w},
abstract ={Statins are a class of drug widely prescribed for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, with pleiotropic cellular effects. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), which converts the metabolite HMG-CoA into mevalonate. Recent discoveries have shown HMG-CoA is a reactive metabolite that can non-enzymatically modify proteins and impact their activity. Therefore, we predicted that inhibition of HMGCR by statins might increase HMG-CoA levels and protein modifications. Upon statin treatment, we observe a strong increase in HMG-CoA levels and modification of only a single protein. Mass spectrometry identifies this protein as fatty acid synthase (FAS), which is modified on active site residues and, importantly, on nonlysine side-chains. The dynamic modifications occur only on a sub-pool of FAS that is located near HMGCR and alters cellular signaling around the ER and Golgi. These results uncover communication between cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis by the substrate of one pathway inhibiting another in a rapid and reversible manner.},

abstract ={Basic structure studies of the biosynthetic machinery of the cell by electron microscopy (EM) have underpinned much of our fundamental knowledge in the areas of molecular cell biology and membrane traffic. Driven by our collective desire to understand how changes in the complex and dynamic structure of this enigmatic organelle relate to its pivotal roles in the cell, the comparatively high-resolution glimpses of the Golgi and other compartments of the secretory pathway offered to us through EM have helped to inspire the development and application of some of our most informative, complimentary (molecular, biochemical and genetic) approaches. Even so, no one has yet even come close to relating the basic molecular mechanisms of transport, through and from the Golgi, to its ultrastructure, to everybody's satisfaction. Over the past decade, EM tomography has afforded new insights into structure-function relationships of the Golgi and provoked a re-evaluation of older paradigms. By providing a set of tools for structurally dissecting cells at high-resolution in three-dimensions (3D), EM tomography has emerged as a method for studying molecular cell biology in situ. As we move rapidly toward the establishment of molecular atlases of organelles through advances in proteomics and genomics, tomographic studies of the Golgi offer the tantalizing possibility that one day, we will be able to map the spatio-temporal coordinates of Golgi-related proteins and lipids accurately in the context of 4D cellular space.},

title ={Preferential electrostatic interactions of phosphatidic acid with arginines},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.1039/d4sm00088a},
abstract ={Phosphatidic acid (PA) is an anionic lipid that preferentially interacts with proteins in a diverse set of cellular processes such as transport, apoptosis, and neurotransmission. One such interaction is that of the PA lipids with the proteins of voltage-sensitive ion channels. In comparison to several other similarly charged anionic lipids, PA lipids exhibit much stronger interactions. Intrigued and motivated by this finding, we sought out to gain deeper understanding into the electrostatic interactions of anionic lipids with charged proteins. Using the voltage sensor domain (VSD) of the KvAP channel as a model system, we performed long-timescale atomistic simulations to analyze the interactions of POPA, POPG, and POPI lipids with arginines (ARGs). Our simulations reveal two mechanisms. First, POPA is able to interact not only with surface ARGs but is able to snorkel and interact with a buried arginine. POPG and POPI lipids on the other hand show weak interactions even with both the surface and buried ARGs. Second, deprotonated POPA with À2 charge is able to break the salt-bridge connection between VSD protein segments and establish its own electrostatic bond with the ARG. Based on these findings, we propose a headgroup size hypothesis for preferential solvation of proteins by charged lipids. These findings may be valuable in understanding how PA lipids could be modulating kinematics of transmembrane proteins in cellular membranes.},

doi ={10.1101/2024.05.01.592120},
abstract ={Live cell imaging of lipids and other metabolites is a long-standing challenge in cell biology. Bioorthogonal labeling tools allow for the conjugation of fluorophores to several phospholipid classes, but cannot discern their trafficking between adjacent organelles or asymmetry across individual membrane leaflets. Here we present fluorogen-activating coincidence sensing (FACES), a chemogenetic tool capable of quantitatively imaging subcellular lipid pools and reporting their transbilayer orientation in living cells. FACES combines bioorthogonal chemistry with genetically encoded fluorogen-activating proteins (FAPs) for reversible proximity sensing of conjugated molecules. We first validate this approach for quantifying discrete phosphatidylcholine pools in the ER and mitochondria that are trafficked by lipid transfer proteins. We then show that transmembrane domain-containing FAPs can be used to reveal the membrane asymmetry of multiple lipid classes that are generated in the trans-Golgi network. Lastly, we demonstrate that FACES is a generalizable tool for subcellular bioorthogonal imaging by measuring changes in mitochondrial N-acetylhexosamine levels. These results demonstrate the use of fluorogenic tags for spatially-defined molecular imaging.},

doi ={10.1242/jcs.217992},
abstract ={Metabolic disorders, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), are emerging as epidemics that affect the global population. One facet of these disorders is attributed to the disturbance of membrane lipid composition. Perturbation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis through alteration in membrane phospholipids activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) and causes dramatic transcriptional and translational changes in the cell. To restore cellular homeostasis, the three highly conserved UPR transducers ATF6, IRE1 (also known as ERN1 in mammals) and PERK (also known as EIF2AK3 in mammals) mediate adaptive responses upon ER stress. The homeostatic UPR cascade is well characterised under conditions of proteotoxic stress, but much less so under lipid bilayer stress-induced UPR. Here, we show that disrupted phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis in Caenorhabditis elegans causes lipid bilayer stress, lipid droplet accumulation and ER stress induction. Transcriptional profiling of PC-deficient worms revealed a unique subset of genes regulated in a UPR-dependent manner that is independent from proteotoxic stress. Among these, we show that autophagy is modulated through the conserved IRE-1-XBP-1 axis, strongly suggesting of the importance of autophagy in maintaining cellular homeostasis during the lipid bilayer stress-induced UPR.},

title ={Non-disruptive inducible labeling of ER-membrane contact sites using the Lamin B Receptor},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.1101/2024.05.31.596797},
abstract ={Membrane contact sites (MCSs) are areas of close proximity between organelles that allow the exchange of material, among other roles. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has MCSs with a variety of organelles in the cell. MCSs are dynamic, responding to changes in cell state, and are therefore best visualized through inducible labeling methods. However, existing methods typically distort ER-MCSs, by expanding contacts or creating artificial ones. Here we describe a new method for inducible labeling of ER-MCSs using the Lamin B receptor (LBR) and a generic anchor protein on the partner organelle. Termed LaBeRling, this versatile, one-to-many approach allows labeling of different types of ER-MCSs (mitochondria, plasma membrane, lysosomes, early endosomes, lipid droplets and Golgi), on-demand, in interphase or mitotic cells. LaBeRling is non-disruptive and does not change ER-MCSs in terms of the contact number, extent or distance measured; as determined by light microscopy or a deep-learning volume electron microscopy approach. We applied this method to study the changes in ER-MCSs during mitosis and to label novel ER-Golgi contact sites at different mitotic stages in live cells. membrane contact sites | ER-Golgi contacts | inducible labeling},

doi ={10.1371/journal.pbio.3001431},
abstract ={To survive elevated temperatures, ectotherms adjust the fluidity of membranes by fine-tuning lipid desaturation levels in a process previously described to be cell autonomous. We have discovered that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, neuronal heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), the conserved master regulator of the heat shock response (HSR), causes extensive fat remodeling in peripheral tissues. These changes include a decrease in fat desaturase and acid lipase expression in the intestine and a global shift in the saturation levels of plasma membrane's phospholipids. The observed remodeling of plasma membrane is in line with ectothermic adaptive responses and gives worms a cumulative advantage to warm temperatures. We have determined that at least 6 TAX-2/TAX-4 cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) gated channel expressing sensory neurons, and transforming growth factor ß (TGF-β)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) are required for signaling across tissues to modulate fat desaturation. We also find neuronal hsf-1 is not only sufficient but also partially necessary to control the fat remodeling response and for survival at warm temperatures. This is the first study to show that a thermostat-based mechanism can cell nonautonomously coordinate membrane saturation and composition across tissues in a multicellular animal.},

doi ={10.1101/2024.05.27.596058},
abstract ={Lipid transfer through membrane contact has been implicated to support vesicular transport, but a mechanistic understanding of this process remains to be achieved. Here, examining Coat Protein I (COPI) transport, we find that phosphatidylcholine (PC) with short acyl chains (sPC), which is needed to support COPI vesicle fission, is delivered through membrane contact from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex at sites of COPI vesicle formation. Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein beta (PITP) plays a central role in this delivery by not only catalyzing PC transfer, but also forming membrane contact. By combining cell-based studies with reconstitution approaches, we achieve spatial and temporal detail in explaining how sPC delivery occurs. Our findings advance the mechanistic understanding of how membrane contact is needed for vesicular transport in a model pathway and shed new insights into how PITP acts.},

Instead, it is proposed that Golgi apparatus proteins continuously recycle via the endoplasmic reticulum by vesicle transport, whereas cargo molecules remain in maturing cisternal structures. Rather than forming a rigid matrix, structural Golgi proteins might be highly dynamic and recycle via the cytoplasm. I will discuss the evidence for these claims and consider whether or not they really disprove older ideas on how the Golgi apparatus is structured and performs its function.},

abstract ={The vast majority of proteins that a cell secretes or displays on its surface first enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they fold and assemble. Only properly assembled proteins advance from the ER to the cell surface. To ascertain fidelity in protein folding, cells regulate the protein-folding capacity in the ER according to need. The ER responds to the burden of unfolded proteins in its lumen (ER stress) by activating intracellular signal transduction pathways, collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). Together, at least three mechanistically distinct branches of the UPR regulate the expression of numerous genes that maintain homeostasis in the ER or induce apoptosis if ER stress remains unmitigated. Recent advances shed light on mechanistic complexities and on the role of the UPR in numerous diseases.},

abstract ={The Golgi apparatus regulates the process of modification and subcellular localization of macromolecules, including proteins and lipids. Aberrant protein sorting caused by defects in the Golgi leads to various diseases in mammals. However, the role of the Golgi apparatus in organismal longevity remained largely unknown. By employing a quantitative proteomic approach, we demonstrated that MON-2, an evolutionarily conserved Arf-GEF protein implicated in Golgi-to-endosome trafficking, promotes longevity via upregulating macroautophagy/ autophagy in C. elegans. Our data using cultured mammalian cells indicate that MON2 translocates from the Golgi to the endosome under starvation conditions, subsequently increasing autophagic flux by binding LGG-1/GABARAPL2. Thus, Golgi-to-endosome trafficking appears to be an evolutionarily conserved process for the upregulation of autophagy, which contributes to organismal longevity.},

abstract ={Aims/hypothesis The minor A allele of rs373863828 (CREBRF p.Arg457Gln) is associated with increased BMI, but reduced risk of type 2 and gestational diabetes in Polynesian (Pacific peoples and Aotearoa New Zealand Māori) populations. This study investigates the effect of the A allele on insulin release and sensitivity in overweight/obese men without diabetes. Methods A mixed meal tolerance test was completed by 172 men (56 with the A allele) of Māori or Pacific ancestry, and 44 (24 with the A allele) had a frequently sampled IVGTT and hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. Mixed linear models with covariates age, ancestry and BMI were used to analyse the association between the A allele of rs373863828 and markers of insulin release and blood glucose regulation. Results The A allele of rs373863828 is associated with a greater increase in plasma insulin 30 min following a meal challenge without affecting the elevation in plasma glucose or incretins glucagon-like polypeptide-1 or gastric inhibitory polypeptide. Consistent with this point, following an i.v. infusion of a glucose bolus, participants with an A allele had higher early (p < 0.05 at 2 and 4 min) plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations for a similar elevation in blood glucose as those homozygous for the major (G) allele. Despite increased plasma insulin, rs373863828 genotype was not associated with a significant difference (p > 0.05) in insulin sensitivity index or glucose disposal during hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. Conclusions/interpretation rs373863828-A allele associates with increased glucose-stimulated insulin release without affecting insulin sensitivity, suggesting that CREBRF p.Arg457Gln may increase insulin release to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.},

doi ={10.1242/jcs.211102},
abstract ={Many secretory cells increase the synthesis and secretion of cargo proteins in response to specific stimuli. How cells couple increased cargo load with a coordinate rise in secretory capacity to ensure efficient transport is not well understood. We used thyroid cells stimulated with thyrotropin (TSH) to demonstrate a coordinate increase in the production of thyroid-specific cargo proteins and ER-Golgi transport factors, and a parallel expansion of the Golgi complex. TSH also increased expression of the CREB3L1 transcription factor, which alone caused amplified transport factor levels and Golgi enlargement. Furthermore, CREB3L1 potentiated the TSH-induced increase in Golgi volume. A dominant-negative CREB3L1 construct hampered the ability of TSH to induce Golgi expansion, implying that this transcription factor contributes to Golgi expansion. Our findings support a model in which CREB3L1 acts as a downstream effector of TSH to regulate the expression of cargo proteins, and simultaneously increases the synthesis of transport factors and the expansion of the Golgi to synchronize the rise in cargo load with the amplified capacity of the secretory pathway.},

abstract ={Biological membranes are key elements for the maintenance of cell architecture and physiology. Beyond a pure barrier separating the inner space of the cell from the outer, the plasma membrane is a scaffold and player in cell-to-cell communication and the initiation of intracellular signals among other functions. Critical to this function is the plasma membrane compartmentalization in lipid microdomains that control the localization and productive interactions of proteins involved in cell signal propagation. In addition, cells are divided into compartments limited by other membranes whose integrity and homeostasis are finely controlled, and which determine the identity and function of the different organelles. Here, we review current knowledge on membrane lipid composition in the plasma membrane and endomembrane compartments, emphasizing its role in sustaining organelle structure and function. The correct composition and structure of cell membranes define key pathophysiological aspects of cells. Therefore, we explore the therapeutic potential of manipulating membrane lipid composition with approaches like membrane lipid therapy, aiming to normalize cell functions through the modification of membrane lipid bilayers.},

abstract ={Lipid mobilization through fatty acid β-oxidation is a central process essential for energy production during nutrient shortage. In yeast, this catabolic process starts in the peroxisome from where β-oxidation products enter mitochondria and fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Little is known about the physical and metabolic cooperation between these organelles. Here we found that expression of fatty acid transporters and of the rate-limiting enzyme involved in β-oxidation is decreased in cells expressing a hyperactive mutant of the small GTPase Arf1, leading to an accumulation of fatty acids in lipid droplets. Consequently, mitochondria became fragmented and ATP synthesis decreased. Genetic and pharmacological depletion of fatty acids phenocopied the arf1 mutant mitochondrial phenotype. Although β-oxidation occurs in both mitochondria and peroxisomes in mammals, Arf1's role in fatty acid metabolism is conserved. Together, our results indicate that Arf1 integrates metabolism into energy production by regulating fatty acid storage and utilization, and presumably organelle contact sites.},

year ={2010},
doi ={10.1210/en.2010-0137},
abstract ={Old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS) has previously been shown to be a putative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor in astrocytes with a mechanism of activation that is similar to ATF6. In this study we investigated the expression and activation of endogenous and overexpressed OASIS in pancreatic ␤-cells. OASIS mRNA expression was detected in pancreatic ␤-cell lines and rodent islets, and the expression level was up-regulated by ER stress-inducing compounds. Endogenous OASIS protein, however, is expressed at low levels in pancreatic ␤-cell lines and rodent islets, possibly due to abundant levels of the micro-RNA miR-140 present in these cells. In contrast, expression of both full-length and cleaved (active) OASIS was readily detectable in the developing mouse pancreas (embryonic d 15.5). Microarray analysis after expression of an active nuclearlocalized version of OASIS in an inducible INS-1 ␤-cell line resulted in the up-regulation of many genes implicated in extracellular matrix production and protein transport but not classical ER stress response genes. Consistent with this, expression of active OASIS failed to induce glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa promoter activity in pancreatic ␤-cells. These results suggest that the repertoire of genes induced by OASIS is cell type-dependent and that the OASIS protein may have a role in pancreas development. (Endocrinology 151: 4146-4157, 2010},

title ={Drug-induced phospholipidosis confounds drug repurposing for SARS-CoV-2},
year ={2024},
doi ={},
abstract ={Repurposing drugs as treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has drawn much attention. Beginning with sigma receptor ligands and expanding to other drugs from screening in the field, we became concerned that phospholipidosis was a shared mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of many repurposed drugs. For all of the 23 cationic amphiphilic drugs we tested, including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, amiodarone, and four others already in clinical trials, phospholipidosis was monotonically correlated with antiviral efficacy. Conversely, drugs active against the same targets that did not induce phospholipidosis were not antiviral. Phospholipidosis depends on the physicochemical properties of drugs and does not reflect specific targetbased activities-rather, it may be considered a toxic confound in early drug discovery. Early detection of phospholipidosis could eliminate these artifacts, enabling a focus on molecules with therapeutic potential.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1101/2021.11.16.468906},
abstract ={The redox reagent dithiothreitol (DTT) causes stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by disrupting its oxidative protein folding environment, which results in the accumulation and misfolding of the newly synthesized proteins. DTT may potentially impact cellular physiology by ER-independent mechanisms; however, such mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Using the nematode model Caenorhabditis elegans, here we show that DTT toxicity is modulated by the bacterial diet. Specifically, the dietary component vitamin B12 alleviates DTT toxicity in a methionine synthase-dependent manner. Using a forward genetic screen, we identify that loss-of-function of R08E5.3, an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)dependent methyltransferase, imparts resistance to DTT. DTT upregulates R08E5.3 expression and modulates the activity of the methionine-homocysteine cycle. Employing genetic studies, we show that DTT toxicity is a result of the depletion of SAM. Finally, we show that a functional IRE-1/XBP-1 unfolded protein response pathway is required to counteract toxicity at high, but not low, DTT concentrations.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-021-27279-4},
abstract ={AGPATs (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferases) catalyze the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid to form phosphatidic acid (PA), a key step in the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway for the synthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerols. AGPAT2 is the only AGPAT isoform whose loss-of-function mutations cause a severe form of human congenital generalized lipodystrophy. Paradoxically, AGPAT2 deficiency is known to dramatically increase the level of its product, PA. Here, we find that AGPAT2 deficiency impairs the biogenesis and growth of lipid droplets. We show that AGPAT2 deficiency compromises the stability of CDPdiacylglycerol (DAG) synthases (CDSs) and decreases CDS activity in both cell lines and mouse liver. Moreover, AGPAT2 and CDS1/2 can directly interact and form functional complexes, which promote the metabolism of PA along the CDP-DAG pathway of phospholipid synthesis. Our results provide key insights into the regulation of metabolic flux during lipid synthesis and suggest substrate channelling at a major branch point of the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway.},

title ={Cell-surface glycans are quantitative reporters of Golgi dysfunction in single cells},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.1101/2024.06.17.599374},
abstract ={Complex sugar polymers known as glycans contribute to the high molecular diversity of the eukaryotic cell surface. The types and levels of glycans on one cell can be sensed by other cells using carbohydrate-specific binding proteins such as lectins, enabling glycans to regulate cell-cell interactions. Glycans are covalently assembled onto proteins and lipids as they traverse the secretory pathway, a tightly regulated process known as glycosylation and carried out by Golgi-resident enzymes. Errors in glycosylation due to the dysfunctional trafficking of enzymes and substrates in the Golgi are implicated in human diseases. Here we ask how much information about Golgi dysfunction is encoded by surface glycans in single cells. This task is challenging due to high cell-to-cell variability in glycan levels. We exploited the loss-of-adhesion driven disorganization of the Golgi in mouse fibroblasts to generate a highly reproducible gradient of Golgi morphology phenotypes, by titrating the Arf1 inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA). We measured the resulting distribution of cell-surface glycans in single cells using two fluorescently tagged lectin probes (ConA and WGA). A mathematical model of intracellular traffic, parameterized against measurements of Golgi fragmentation and endocytosis, quantitatively explains cell-surface lectin levels across time and BFA concentrations. We used this model to construct an optimal Bayesian decoder and showed that singlecell lectin measurements predict Golgi phenotypes with accuracy far greater than chance. By combining signals from two lectins we further improved prediction accuracy and speed. Such multilectin information may be exploited during natural cell-cell communication, and in the development of single-cell diagnostics.},

title ={GBF1 and Arf1 interact with Miro and regulate mitochondrial positioning within cells},
year ={2018},
doi ={10.1038/s41598-018-35190-0},
abstract ={The spatial organization of cells depends on coordination between cytoskeletal systems and intracellular organelles. The Arf1 small G protein and its activator GBF1 are important regulators of Golgi organization, maintaining its morphology and function. Here we show that GBF1 and its substrate Arf1 regulate the spatial organization of mitochondria in a microtubule-dependent manner. Miro is a mitochondrial membrane protein that interacts through adaptors with microtubule motor proteins such as cytoplasmic dynein, the major microtubule minus end directed motor. We demonstrate a physical interaction between GBF1 and Miro, and also between the active GTP-bound form of Arf1 and Miro. Inhibition of GBF1, inhibition of Arf1 activation, or overexpression of Miro, caused a collapse of the mitochondrial network towards the centrosome. The change in mitochondrial morphology upon GBF1 inhibition was due to a twofold increase in the time engaged in retrograde movement compared to control conditions. Electron tomography revealed that GBF1 inhibition also resulted in larger mitochondria with more complex morphology. Miro silencing or drug inhibition of cytoplasmic dynein activity blocked the GBF1-dependent repositioning of mitochondria. Our results show that blocking GBF1 function promotes dynein-and Miro-dependent retrograde mitochondrial transport along microtubules towards the microtubule-organizing center, where they form an interconnected network.},

title ={Genes in human obesity loci are causal obesity genes in C. elegans},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1009736},
abstract ={Obesity and its associated metabolic syndrome are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Given the disease's heavy burden on patients and the healthcare system, there has been increased interest in identifying pharmacological targets for the treatment and prevention of obesity. Towards this end, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of human genetic variants associated with obesity. The next challenge is to experimentally define which of these variants are causally linked to obesity, and could therefore become targets for the treatment or prevention of obesity. Here we employ highthroughput in vivo RNAi screening to test for causality 293 C. elegans orthologs of human obesity-candidate genes reported in GWAS. We RNAi screened these 293 genes in C. elegans subject to two different feeding regimens: (1) regular diet, and (2) high-fructose diet, which we developed and present here as an invertebrate model of diet-induced obesity (DIO). We report 14 genes that promote obesity and 3 genes that prevent DIO when silenced in C. elegans. Further, we show that knock-down of the 3 DIO genes not only prevents excessive fat accumulation in primary and ectopic fat depots but also improves the health and extends the lifespan of C. elegans overconsuming fructose. Importantly, the direction of the association between expression variants in these loci and obesity in mice and humans matches the phenotypic outcome of the loss-of-function of the C. elegans ortholog genes, supporting the notion that some of these genes would be causally linked to obesity across phylogeny. Therefore, in addition to defining causality for several genes so far merely correlated with obesity, this study demonstrates the value of model systems compatible with in vivo high-throughput genetic screening to causally link GWAS gene candidates to human diseases.},

title ={An antisteatosis response regulated by oleic acid through lipid droplet-mediated ERAD enhancement},
year ={2024},
doi ={},
abstract ={Although excessive lipid accumulation is a hallmark of obesity-related pathologies, some lipids are beneficial. Oleic acid (OA), the most abundant monounsaturated fatty acid (FA), promotes health and longevity. Here, we show that OA benefits Caenorhabditis elegans by activating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transcription factor SKN-1A (Nrf1/NFE2L1) in a lipid homeostasis response. SKN-1A/Nrf1 is cleared from the ER by the ERassociated degradation (ERAD) machinery and stabilized when proteasome activity is low and canonically maintains proteasome homeostasis. Unexpectedly, OA increases nuclear SKN-1A levels independently of proteasome activity, through lipid droplet-dependent enhancement of ERAD. In turn, SKN-1A reduces steatosis by reshaping the lipid metabolism transcriptome and mediates longevity from OA provided through endogenous accumulation, reduced H3K4 trimethylation, or dietary supplementation. Our findings reveal an unexpected mechanism of FA signal transduction, as well as a lipid homeostasis pathway that provides strategies for opposing steatosis and aging, and may mediate some benefits of the OA-rich Mediterranean diet.},

year ={2008},
doi ={10.1021/bi702468g},
abstract ={The genome of Caenorhabditis elegans encodes for 18 putative nucleotide sugar transporters even though its glycome only contains 7 different monosaccharides. To understand the biological significance of this phenomenon, we have begun a systematic substrate characterization of the above putative transporters and have determined that the gene ZK896.9 encodes a Golgi apparatus transporter for UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine. This is the first tetrasubstrate nucleotide sugar transporter characterized for any organism and is also the first nonplant transporter for UDP-glucose. Evidence for the above substrate specificity and substrate transport saturation kinetics was obtained by expression of ZK896.9 in Saccharomyces cereVisiae followed by Golgi enriched vesicle isolation and assays in Vitro. Further evidence for UDP-glucose transport was obtained by expression of ZK 896.9 in Giardia lamblia, an organism recently characterized as having endogenous transport activity for only UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Expression of ZK896.9 was also able to correct the phenotype of a mutant Chinese ovary cell line specifically defective in the transport of UDP-galactose into the Golgi apparatus and of a mutant of the yeast KluyVeromyces lactis specifically defective in the transport of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine into its Golgi apparatus. Because up to now all three other characterized nucleotide sugar transporters of C. elegans have been found to transport two or three substrates, the substrate specificity of ZK896.9 raises questions as to the evolutionary ancestry of this group of proteins in this nematode.},

title ={Ultralow Background Membrane Editors for Spatiotemporal Control of Phosphatidic Acid Metabolism and Signaling},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.1021/acscentsci.3c01105},
abstract ={Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a multifunctional lipid with important metabolic and signaling functions, and efforts to dissect its pleiotropy demand strategies for perturbing its levels with spatiotemporal precision. Previous membrane editing approaches for generating local PA pools used light-mediated induced proximity to recruit a PA-synthesizing enzyme, phospholipase D (PLD), from the cytosol to the target organelle membrane. Whereas these optogenetic PLDs exhibited high activity, their residual activity in the dark led to undesired chronic lipid production. Here, we report ultralow background membrane editors for PA wherein light directly controls PLD catalytic activity, as opposed to localization and access to substrates, exploiting a light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain-based conformational photoswitch inserted into the PLD sequence and enabling their stable and nonperturbative targeting to multiple organelle membranes. By coupling organelle-targeted LOVPLD activation to lipidomics analysis, we discovered different rates of metabolism for PA and its downstream products depending on the subcellular location of PA production. We also elucidated signaling roles for PA pools on different membranes in conferring local activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling. This work illustrates how membrane editors featuring acute, optogenetic conformational switches can provide new insights into organelle-selective lipid metabolic and signaling pathways.},

title ={Membrane Architecture in the Spotlight of Correlative Microscopy},
year ={2020},
doi ={10.1016/j.tcb.2020.04.003},
abstract ={Cellular membranes differ in their molecular organisation, shape, and dynamics. Knowing how these properties of membrane architecture relate to the presence and function of specific membrane components is fundamental for understanding membrane-associated cellular processes. Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) is ideally poised to address such problems. Fluorescence microscopy allows identification of cellular membranes through labelled components and can provide temporal information, while electron microscopy allows visualisation of the structure of the same membranes at high resolution. In recent years, various CLEM protocols have been applied to gain insights into cellular membrane architecture. Here, we review conceptually novel approaches by which CLEM has provided insights on membrane reshaping, subcellular localisation of components, host-pathogen interactions, and has answered longstanding mechanistic questions. Membrane Architecture: Organisation at Multiple Levels and Resolution Scales Highlights New CLEM approaches allow addressing diverse questions on cellular membrane architecture. CLEM can add temporal and compositional information to membrane shape and topology, and can facilitate identification of rare structures or events. The large diversity of CLEM protocols permits precisely tailoring the experimental setup to specific biological questions. The conceptual advances enabled by CLEM emphasise the importance of architecture for membrane-associated cellular functions.},

title ={Preferential electrostatic interactions of phosphatidic acid with arginines},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.1039/d4sm00088a},
abstract ={Phosphatidic acid (PA) is an anionic lipid that preferentially interacts with proteins in a diverse set of cellular processes such as transport, apoptosis, and neurotransmission. One such interaction is that of the PA lipids with the proteins of voltage-sensitive ion channels. In comparison to several other similarly charged anionic lipids, PA lipids exhibit much stronger interactions. Intrigued and motivated by this finding, we sought out to gain deeper understanding into the electrostatic interactions of anionic lipids with charged proteins. Using the voltage sensor domain (VSD) of the KvAP channel as a model system, we performed long-timescale atomistic simulations to analyze the interactions of POPA, POPG, and POPI lipids with arginines (ARGs). Our simulations reveal two mechanisms. First, POPA is able to interact not only with surface ARGs but is able to snorkel and interact with a buried arginine. POPG and POPI lipids on the other hand show weak interactions even with both the surface and buried ARGs. Second, deprotonated POPA with À2 charge is able to break the salt-bridge connection between VSD protein segments and establish its own electrostatic bond with the ARG. Based on these findings, we propose a headgroup size hypothesis for preferential solvation of proteins by charged lipids. These findings may be valuable in understanding how PA lipids could be modulating kinematics of transmembrane proteins in cellular membranes.},

title ={Endoplasmic reticulum stress in HepG2 cells inhibits apolipoprotein A-I secretion},
year ={2012},
doi ={10.1016/j.lfs.2012.11.001},
abstract ={Aims: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress modulates gene expression and has been implicated in causing dyslipidemias. To determine if ER stress may contribute to hypoalphalipoproteinemia through suppression of apo A-I gene expression, human hepatoma cell line Hep G2 was treated with ER stress inducers and the changes in apo A-I gene expression were compared to albumin gene expression. Main methods: HepG2 cells were treated with tunicamycin (TM) and thapsigargin (TG), two potent inducers of ER stress, and apo A-I and albumin protein levels, mRNA levels, and promoter activity were measured. ER stress was measured using the ER stress-responsive alkaline phosphatase assay and by Western blot quantitation of ER stress markers such as glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP-78), phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinase (phospho-JNK), total JNK, phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (phospho eIF2α), and total eIF2α. Key findings: TM and TG induced ER stress in HepG2 cells and reduced apo A-I and albumin secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Intracellular albumin levels increased in cells treated with TM and TG while intracellular apo A-I levels decreased. Albumin mRNA and albumin gene promoter activity were reduced in proportion to the decrease in albumin secreted while changes in the apo A-I mRNA levels and promoter activity were modest and did not account for the reduction in apo A-I secretion. Significance: These results indicate that apo A-I secretion is inhibited by ER stress possibly by affecting cellular degradation pathways. However, ER stress does not affect apo A-I secretion by regulating gene expression.},

year ={2017},
doi ={10.1038/s41388-017-0023-0},
abstract ={In order to better understand the process of breast cancer metastasis, we have generated a mammary epithelial progression series of increasingly aggressive cell lines that metastasize to lung. Here, we demonstrate that up-regulation of an Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) to Golgi trafficking gene signature in metastatic cells enhances transport kinetics, which promotes malignant progression. We observe increased ER-Golgi trafficking, an altered secretome and sensitivity to the retrograde transport inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) in cells that metastasize to lung. CREB3 was identified as a transcriptional regulator of up-regulated ER-Golgi trafficking genes ARF4, COPB1 and USO1, and silencing of these genes attenuated the metastatic phenotype in vitro and lung colonization in vivo. Furthermore, high trafficking gene expression significantly correlated with increased risk of distant metastasis and reduced relapse-free and overall survival in breast cancer patients, suggesting that modulation of ER-Golgi trafficking plays an important role in metastatic progression.},

abstract ={In mammalian cells, >25% of synthesized proteins are exported through the secretory pathway. The pathway complexity, however, obfuscates its impact on the secretion of different proteins. Unraveling its impact on diverse proteins is particularly important for biopharmaceutical production. Here we delineate the core secretory pathway functions and integrate them with genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of human, mouse, and Chinese hamster ovary cells. The resulting reconstructions enable the computation of energetic costs and machinery demands of each secreted protein. By integrating additional omics data, we find that highly secretory cells have adapted to reduce expression and secretion of other expensive host cell proteins. Furthermore, we predict metabolic costs and maximum productivities of biotherapeutic proteins and identify protein features that most significantly impact protein secretion. Finally, the model successfully predicts the increase in secretion of a monoclonal antibody after silencing a highly expressed selection marker. This work represents a knowledgebase of the mammalian secretory pathway that serves as a novel tool for systems biotechnology.},

title ={ER Unfolded Protein Response in Liver In Vivo Is Characterized by Reduced, Not Increased, De Novo Lipogenesis and Cholesterol Synthesis Rates with Uptake of Fatty Acids from Adipose Tissue: Integrated Gene Expression, Translation Rates and Metabolic Fluxes},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.3390/ijms23031073},
abstract ={The unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum (UPR ER) is involved in a number of metabolic diseases. Here, we characterize UPR ER-induced metabolic changes in mouse livers in vivo through metabolic labeling and mass spectrometric analysis of lipid and proteome-wide fluxes. We induced UPR ER by tunicamycin administration and measured synthesis rates of proteins, fatty acids and cholesterol, as well as RNA-seq. Contrary to reports in isolated cells, hepatic de novo lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis were markedly reduced, as were mRNA levels and synthesis rates of lipogenic proteins. H&E staining showed enrichment with lipid droplets while electron microscopy revealed ER morphological changes. Interestingly, the pre-labeling of adipose tissue prior to UPR ER induction resulted in the redistribution of labeled fatty acids from adipose tissue to the liver, with replacement by unlabeled glycerol in the liver acylglycerides, indicating that the liver uptake was of free fatty acids, not whole glycerolipids. The redistribution of adipose fatty acids to the liver was not explicable by altered plasma insulin, increased fatty acid levels (lipolysis) or by reduced food intake. Synthesis of most liver proteins was suppressed under UPR ER conditions, with the exception of BiP, other chaperones, protein disulfide isomerases, and proteins of ribosomal biogenesis. Protein synthesis rates generally, but not always, paralleled changes in mRNA. In summary, this combined approach, linking static changes with fluxes, revealed an integrated reduction of lipid and cholesterol synthesis pathways, from gene expression to translation and metabolic flux rates, under UPR ER conditions. The reduced lipogenesis does not parallel human fatty liver disease. This approach provides powerful tools to characterize metabolic processes underlying hepatic UPR ER in vivo.},

title ={Tissue-specific autophagy responses to aging and stress in C. elegans},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={Cellular function relies on a balance between protein synthesis and breakdown. Macromolecular breakdown through autophagy is broadly required for cellular and tissue development, function, and recovery from stress. While Caenorhabditis elegans is frequently used to explore cellular responses to development and stress, the most common assays for autophagy in this system lack tissue-level resolution. Different tissues within an organism have unique functional characteristics and likely vary in their reliance on autophagy under different conditions. To generate a tissuespecific map of autophagy in C. elegans we used a dual fluorescent protein (dFP) tag that releases monomeric fluorescent protein (mFP) upon arrival at the lysosome. Tissue-specific expression of dFP::LGG-1 revealed autophagic flux in all tissues, but mFP accumulation was most dramatic in the intestine. We also observed variable responses to stress: starvation increased autophagic mFP release in all tissues, whereas anoxia primarily increased intestinal autophagic flux. We observed autophagic flux with tagged LGG-1, LGG-2, and two autophagic cargo reporters: a soluble cytoplasmic protein, and mitochondrial TOMM-7. Finally, an increase in mFP in older worms was consistent with an age-dependent shift in proteostasis. These novel measures of autophagic flux in C. elegans reveal heterogeneity in autophagic response across tissues during stress and aging.},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.55745},
abstract ={Lysosomes play important roles in cellular degradation to maintain cell homeostasis. In order to understand whether and how lysosomes alter with age and contribute to lifespan regulation, we characterized multiple properties of lysosomes during the aging process in C. elegans. We uncovered age-dependent alterations in lysosomal morphology, motility, acidity and degradation activity, all of which indicate a decline in lysosome function with age. The ageassociated lysosomal changes are suppressed in the long-lived mutants daf-2, eat-2 and isp-1, which extend lifespan by inhibiting insulin/IGF-1 signaling, reducing food intake and impairing mitochondrial function, respectively. We found that 43 lysosome genes exhibit reduced expression with age, including genes encoding subunits of the proton pump V-ATPase and cathepsin proteases. The expression of lysosome genes is upregulated in the long-lived mutants, and this upregulation requires the functions of DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/NRF2 transcription factors. Impairing lysosome function affects clearance of aggregate-prone proteins and disrupts lifespan extension in daf-2, eat-2 and isp-1 worms. Our data indicate that lysosome function is modulated by multiple longevity pathways and is important for lifespan extension.},

abstract ={Cargo traffic through the Golgi apparatus is mediated by cisternal maturation, but it remains largely unclear how the cis-cisternae, the earliest Golgi sub-compartment, is generated and how the Golgi matures into the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Here, we use high-speed and highresolution confocal microscopy to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of a diverse set of proteins that reside in and around the Golgi in budding yeast. We find many mobile punctate structures that harbor yeast counterparts of mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) proteins, which we term 'yeast ERGIC'. It occasionally exhibits approach and contact behavior toward the ER exit sites and gradually matures into the cis-Golgi. Upon treatment with the Golgi-disrupting agent brefeldin A, the ERGIC proteins form larger aggregates corresponding to the Golgi entry core compartment in plants, while cis-and medial-Golgi proteins are absorbed into the ER. We further analyze the dynamics of several late Golgi proteins to better understand the Golgi-TGN transition. Together with our previous studies, we demonstrate a detailed spatiotemporal profile of the entire cisternal maturation process from the ERGIC to the Golgi and further to the TGN.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.83884},
abstract ={Changes in lipid metabolism are associated with aging and age-related diseases, including proteopathies. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is uniquely a major hub for protein and lipid synthesis, making its function essential for both protein and lipid homeostasis. However, it is less clear how lipid metabolism and protein quality may impact each other. Here, we identified let-767, a putative hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in Caenorhabditis elegans, as an essential gene for both lipid and ER protein homeostasis. Knockdown of let-767 reduces lipid stores, alters ER morphology in a lipid-dependent manner, and blocks induction of the Unfolded Protein Response of the ER (UPR ER). Interestingly, a global reduction in lipogenic pathways restores UPR ER induction in animals with reduced let-767. Specifically, we find that supplementation of 3-oxoacyl, the predicted metabolite directly upstream of let-767, is sufficient to block induction of the UPR ER. This study highlights a novel interaction through which changes in lipid metabolism can alter a cell's response to protein-induced stress.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1093/genetics/iyab093},
abstract ={The composition and biophysical properties of cellular membranes must be tightly regulated to maintain the proper functions of myriad processes within cells. To better understand the importance of membrane homeostasis, we assembled a panel of five Caenorhabditis elegans strains that show a wide span of membrane composition and properties, ranging from excessively rich in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and rigid to excessively rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and fluid. The genotypes of the five strain are, from most rigid to most fluid: paqr-1(tm3262); paqr-2(tm3410), paqr-2(tm3410), N2 (wild-type), mdt-15(et14); nhr-49(et8), and mdt-15(et14); nhr-49(et8); acs-13(et54). We confirmed the excess SFA/rigidity-to-excess PUFA/fluidity gradient using the methods of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and lipidomics analysis. The five strains were then studied for a variety of cellular and physiological traits and found to exhibit defects in: permeability, lipid peroxidation, growth at different temperatures, tolerance to SFA-rich diets, lifespan, brood size, vitellogenin trafficking, oogenesis, and autophagy during starvation. The excessively rigid strains often exhibited defects in opposite directions compared to the excessively fluid strains. We conclude that deviation from wild-type membrane homeostasis is pleiotropically deleterious for numerous cellular/physiological traits. The strains introduced here should prove useful to further study the cellular and physiological consequences of impaired membrane homeostasis.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-021-25398-6},
abstract ={The contents of numerous membrane lipids change upon ageing. However, it is unknown whether and how any of these changes are causally linked to lifespan regulation. Acyl chains contribute to the functional specificity of membrane lipids. In this study, working with C. elegans, we identified an acyl chain-specific sphingolipid, C22 glucosylceramide, as a longevity metabolite. Germline deficiency, a conserved lifespan-extending paradigm, induces somatic expression of the fatty acid elongase ELO-3, and behenic acid (22:0) generated by ELO-3 is incorporated into glucosylceramide for lifespan regulation. Mechanistically, C22 glucosylceramide is required for the membrane localization of clathrin, a protein that regulates membrane budding. The reduction in C22 glucosylceramide impairs the clathrin-dependent autophagic lysosome reformation, which subsequently leads to TOR activation and longevity suppression. These findings reveal a mechanistic link between membrane lipids and ageing and suggest a model of lifespan regulation by fatty acid-mediated membrane configuration.},

title ={Dependence of Site-2 Protease Cleavage of ATF6 on Prior Site-1 Protease Digestion Is Determined by the Size of the Luminal Domain of ATF6},
year ={2004},
doi ={10.1074/jbc.M408466200},
abstract ={ATF6 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membraneanchored transcription factor activated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis in the ER stress response. The release of the cytosolic transcription factor domain of ATF6 requires the sequential processing by the Golgi site-1 and site-2 proteases (S1P and S2P). It has been unclear why S2P proteolysis relies on previous site-1 cleavage. One possibility is that S2P localizes to a different cellular compartment than S1P; however, here we show that S2P localizes to the same compartment as S1P, the cis/medial-Golgi. In addition, we have re-localized S1P and S2P to the ER with brefeldin A and find that the sequential cleavage of ATF6 is reconstituted in the ER. The mapping of the region of ATF6 required for sequential S1P and S2P cleavage showed that short luminal domains resulted in S1P-independent S2P cleavage. The addition of artificial domains onto these short ATF6 luminal domains restored the S1P dependence of S2P cleavage, suggesting that it is the size rather than specific sequences in the luminal domain that determines the S1P dependence of S2P cleavage. These results suggest that the bulky ATF6 luminal domain blocks S2P cleavage and that the role of S1P is to reduce the size of the luminal domain to prepare ATF6 to be an optimal S2P substrate.},

abstract ={The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest organelle of the cell and participates in multiple essential functions, including the production of secretory proteins, lipid synthesis, and calcium storage. Sustaining proteostasis requires an intimate coupling with energy production. Mitochondrial respiration evolved to be functionally connected to ER physiology through a physical interface between both organelles known as mitochondria-associated membranes. This quasi-synaptic structure acts as a signaling hub that tunes the function of both organelles in a bidirectional manner and controls proteostasis, cell death pathways, and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Here, we discuss the main signaling mechanisms governing interorganellar communication and their putative role in diseases including cancer and neurodegeneration.},

doi ={10.1101/2023.02.13.528342},
abstract ={The nuclear envelope (NE) is a subdomain of the ER with prominent roles in nuclear organization, largely mediated by its distinctive protein composition. We developed methods to reveal novel, low abundance transmembrane (TM) proteins concentrated at the NE relative to the peripheral ER. Using label-free proteomics that compared isolated NEs to cytoplasmic membranes, we first identified proteins with apparent NE enrichment. In subsequent authentication, ectopically expressed candidates were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy to quantify their targeting to the NE in cultured cells. Ten proteins from a validation set were found to associate preferentially with the NE, including oxidoreductases, enzymes for lipid biosynthesis and regulators of cell growth and survival. We determined that one of the validated candidates, the palmitoyltransferase Zdhhc6, modifies the NE oxidoreductase Tmx4 and thereby modulates its NE levels. This provides a functional rationale for the NE concentration of Zdhhc6. Overall, our methodology has revealed a group of previously unrecognized proteins concentrated at the NE and additional candidates. Future analysis of these can potentially unveil new mechanistic pathways associated with the NE.},

title ={Lysosomal recycling of amino acids affects ER quality control},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={Recent work has highlighted the fact that lysosomes are a critical signaling hub of metabolic processes, providing fundamental building blocks crucial for anabolic functions. How lysosomal functions affect other cellular compartments is not fully understood. Here, we find that lysosomal recycling of the amino acids lysine and arginine is essential for proper ER quality control through the UPR ER. Specifically, loss of the lysine and arginine amino acid transporter LAAT-1 results in increased sensitivity to proteotoxic stress in the ER and decreased animal physiology. We find that these LAAT-1-dependent effects are linked to glycine metabolism and transport and that the loss of function of the glycine transporter SKAT-1 also increases sensitivity to ER stress. Direct lysine and arginine supplementation, or glycine supplementation alone, can ameliorate increased ER stress sensitivity found in laat-1 mutants. These data implicate a crucial role in recycling lysine, arginine, and glycine in communication between the lysosome and ER.},

abstract ={p38 and c-Jun N-terninal kinase (JNK) are activated in response to acute stress and inflammatory signals. Through modification of a plethora of substrates, these kinases profoundly reshape cellular physiology for the optimal response to a harmful environment and/or an inflammatory state. Here, we utilized phospho-proteomics to identify several hundred substrates for both kinases. Our results indicate that the scale of signaling from p38 and JNK are of a similar magnitude. Among the many new targets, we highlight the regulation of the transcriptional regulators grb10-interacting GYF protein 1 and 2 (GIGYF1/2) by p38-dependent MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding. We also show that the Golgi apparatus contains numerous substrates, and is a major target for regulation by p38 and JNK. When activated, these kinases mediate structural rearrangement of the Golgi apparatus, which positively affects protein flux through the secretory system. Our work expands on our knowledge about p38 and JNK signaling with important biological ramifications.},

doi ={10.1002/1873-3468.13554},
abstract ={Organelles have been studied traditionally as single units, but a novel concept is now emerging: each organelle has distinct functional zones that regulate specific functions. The Golgi apparatus seems to have various zones, including zones for: glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins; proteoglycan, mucin and lipid glycosylation; transport of cholesterol and ceramides; protein degradation (Golgi membrane-associated degradation); and signalling for apoptosis. The capacity for these specific functions and the size of the corresponding zones appear to be tightly regulated by the Golgi stress response to accommodate cellular demands. For instance, the proteoglycan and mucin zones seem to be separately augmented during the differentiation of chondrocytes and goblet cells, respectively. The mammalian Golgi stress response consists of several response pathways. The TFE3 pathway regulates the general function of the Golgi, such as structural maintenance, N-glycosylation and vesicular transport, whereas the proteoglycan pathway increases the expression of glycosylation enzymes for proteoglycans. The CREB3 and HSP47 pathways regulate pro-and anti-apoptotic functions, respectively. These observations indicate that the Golgi is a dynamic organelle, the capacity of which is upregulated according to cellular needs.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1011078},
abstract ={Genetic networks are surprisingly robust to perturbations caused by new mutations. This robustness is conferred in part by compensation for loss of a gene's activity by genes with overlapping functions, such as paralogs. Compensation occurs passively when the normal activity of one paralog can compensate for the loss of the other, or actively when a change in one paralog's expression, localization, or activity is required to compensate for loss of the other. The mechanisms of active compensation remain poorly understood in most cases. Here we investigate active compensation for the loss or reduction in expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene TDH3 by its paralog TDH2. TDH2 is upregulated in a dosedependent manner in response to reductions in TDH3 by a mechanism requiring the shared transcriptional regulators Gcr1p and Rap1p. TDH1, a second and more distantly related paralog of TDH3, has diverged in its regulation and is upregulated by another mechanism. Other glycolytic genes regulated by Rap1p and Gcr1p show changes in expression similar to TDH2, suggesting that the active compensation by TDH3 paralogs is part of a broader homeostatic response mediated by shared transcriptional regulators.},

doi ={10.1091/mbc.E08},
abstract ={Despite extensive work on ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) 1 at the Golgi complex, the functions of Arf2-5 in the secretory pathway, or for that of any Arf at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) remain uncharacterized. Here, we examined the recruitment of fluorescently tagged Arf1,-3,-4, and-5 onto peripheral ERGIC. Live cell imaging detected Arfs on peripheral puncta that also contained Golgi-specific brefeldin A (BFA) resistance factor (GBF) 1 and the ERGIC marker p58. Unexpectedly, BFA did not promote corecruitment of Arfs with GBF1 either at the Golgi complex or the ERGIC, but it uncovered striking differences between Arf1,3 and Arf4,5. Although Arf1,3 quickly dissociated from all endomembranes after BFA addition, Arf4,5 persisted on ERGIC structures, even after redistribution of GBF1 to separate compartments. The GDP-arrested Arf4(T31N) mutant localized to the ERGIC, even with BFA and Exo1 present. In addtion, loss of Arf ⅐ GTP after treatment with Exo1 caused rapid release of all Arfs from the Golgi complex and led to GBF1 accumulation on both Golgi and ERGIC membranes. Our results demonstrate that GDP-bound Arf4,5 associate with ERGIC membranes through binding sites distinct from those responsible for GBF1 recruitment. Furthermore, they provide the first evidence that GBF1 accumulation on membranes may be caused by loss of Arf ⅐ GTP, rather than the formation of an Arf ⅐ GDP ⅐ BFA ⅐ GBF1 complex.},

While research into secretory stress signaling has so far mostly focused on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), emerging data suggest that the Golgi itself serves as an important signaling hub capable of initiating stress responses. To systematically identify novel Golgi stress mediators, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of cells exposed to three different pharmacological compounds known to elicit Golgi fragmentation: brefeldin A, golgicide A, and monensin. Subsequent gene-set enrichment analysis revealed a significant contribution of the ETS family transcription factors ELK1, GABPA/B, and ETS1 to the control of gene expression following compound treatment. Induction of Golgi stress leads to a late activation of the ETS upstream kinases MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, resulting in enhanced ETS factor activity and the transcription of ETS family target genes related to spliceosome function and cell death induction via alternate MCL1 splicing. Further genetic analyses using loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments suggest that these transcription factors operate in parallel.},

abstract ={Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death. This deterioration is the primary risk factor for major human pathologies including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Aging research has experienced an unprecedented advance over recent years, particularly with the discovery that the rate of aging is controlled, at least to some extent, by genetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. This review enumerates nine tentative hallmarks that represent common denominators of aging in different organisms, with special emphasis on mammalian aging. These hallmarks are: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient-sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. A major challenge is to dissect the interconnectedness between the candidate hallmarks and their relative contribution to aging, with the final goal of identifying pharmaceutical targets to improve human health during aging with minimal side-effects.},

Here, we report ultrastructural membrane expansion microscopy (umExM), which combines a novel membrane label and optimized expansion microscopy protocol, to support dense labeling of membranes in tissues for nanoscale visualization. We validated the high signal-to-background ratio, and uniformity and continuity, of umExM membrane labeling in brain slices, which supported the imaging of membranes and proteins at a resolution of ~60 nm on a confocal microscope. We demonstrated the utility of umExM for the segmentation and tracing of neuronal processes, such as axons, in mouse brain tissue. Combining umExM with optical fluctuation imaging, or iterating the expansion process, yielded ~35 nm resolution imaging, pointing towards the potential for electron microscopy resolution visualization of brain membranes on ordinary light microscopes.},

Mixed linear models with covariates age, ancestry and BMI were used to analyse the association between the A allele of rs373863828 and markers of insulin release and blood glucose regulation. Results The A allele of rs373863828 is associated with a greater increase in plasma insulin 30 min following a meal challenge without affecting the elevation in plasma glucose or incretins glucagon-like polypeptide-1 or gastric inhibitory polypeptide. Consistent with this point, following an i.v. infusion of a glucose bolus, participants with an A allele had higher early (p < 0.05 at 2 and 4 min) plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations for a similar elevation in blood glucose as those homozygous for the major (G) allele. Despite increased plasma insulin, rs373863828 genotype was not associated with a significant difference (p > 0.05) in insulin sensitivity index or glucose disposal during hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. Conclusions/interpretation rs373863828-A allele associates with increased glucose-stimulated insulin release without affecting insulin sensitivity, suggesting that CREBRF p.Arg457Gln may increase insulin release to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.},

title ={MLX Is a Transcriptional Repressor of the Mammalian Golgi Stress Response},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={The Golgi stress response is a homeostatic mechanism that controls the capacity of the Golgi apparatus in accordance with cellular demands. When the capacity of the Golgi apparatus becomes insufficient (Golgi stress), transcription levels of Golgi-related genes encoding glycosylation enzymes, a Golgi structural protein, and components of vesicular transport are upregulated through a common cis-acting enhancer-the Golgi apparatus stress response element (GASE). Here, we identified the transcription factor MLX as a GASEbinding protein. MLX resides in the cytoplasm and does not bind to GASE in normal growth conditions, whereas MLX translocates into the nucleus and specifically binds to GASE in response to Golgi stress. Suppression of MLX expression increased transcriptional induction of target genes of the Golgi stress response, whereas overexpression of MLX reduced GASE-binding of TFE3 as well as transcriptional induction from GASE, suggesting that MLX is a transcriptional repressor of the mammalian Golgi stress response.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1083/jcb.202102122},
abstract ={In eukaryote cells, lipid droplets (LDs) are key intracellular organelles that dynamically regulate cellular energy homeostasis. LDs originate from the ER and continuously contact the ER during their growth. How the ER affects LD growth is largely unknown. Here, we show that RNAi knockdown of acs-1, encoding an acyl-CoA synthetase required for the biosynthesis of monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids C15iso and C17iso, remarkably prevented LD growth in Caenorhabditis elegans. Dietary C17iso, or complex lipids with C17iso including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and triacylglycerol, could fully restore the LD growth in the acs-1RNAi worms. Mechanistically, C17iso may incorporate into phospholipids to ensure the membrane integrity of the ER so as to maintain the function of ER-resident enzymes such as SCD/stearoyl-CoA desaturase and DGAT2/diacylglycerol acyltransferase for appropriate lipid synthesis and LD growth. Collectively, our work uncovers a unique fatty acid, C17iso, as the side chain of phospholipids for determining the ER homeostasis for LD growth in an intact organism, C. elegans. .},

year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={The transport of apolipoprotein B (apoB) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi was studied in puromycin-synchronized HepG2 cells, using an antibody that could distinguish between apoB in ER and Golgi compartments. In cells with normal ER-to-Golgi transport, both albumin and apoB colocalized throughout the ER and appeared as intense, compact signals in Golgi. When ER-to-Golgi transport was blocked with brefeldin A, apoB and albumin remained colocalized in the ER network and threedimensional constructed images showed more intense signals for both proteins in a central, perinuclear region of the ER. When protein synthesis was stopped in cells with brefeldin A-inhibited ER-to-Golgi transport, apoB degradation was visualized as a homogeneous decrease in fluorescence signal intensity throughout the ER that could be slowed with clasto-lactacystin ␤-lactone, a proteasome inhibitor. Incubation of cells with CP-10447, an inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, inhibited apoB, but not albumin, transport from ER to Golgi. Nanogold immunoelectron microscopy of digitonin-permeabilized cells showed proteasomes in close proximity to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. Thus, newly synthesized apoB is localized throughout the entire ER and degraded homogeneously, most likely by neighboring proteasomes located on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. Although albumin is colocalized with apoB in the ER, as expected, it was not targeted for ER-associated proteasomal degradation.-Sakata, N., T. E.},

year ={2000},
doi ={},
abstract ={The positional relationships among all of the visible organelles in a densely packed region of cytoplasm from an insulin secreting, cultured mammalian cell have been analyzed in three dimensions (3-D) at Ϸ6 nm resolution. Part of a fast frozen͞freeze-substituted HIT-T15 cell that included a large portion of the Golgi ribbon was reconstructed in 3-D by electron tomography. The reconstructed volume (3.1 ؋ 3.2 ؋ 1.2 m 3) allowed sites of interaction between organelles, and between microtubules and organellar membranes, to be accurately defined in 3-D and quantitatively analyzed by spatial density analyses. Our data confirm that the Golgi in an interphase mammalian cell is a single, ribbon-like organelle composed of stacks of flattened cisternae punctuated by openings of various sizes [Rambourg, A., Clermont, Y., & Hermo, L. (1979) Am. J. Anat. 154, 455-476]. The data also show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a single continuous compartment that forms close contacts with mitochondria, multiple trans Golgi cisternae, and compartments of the endo-lysosomal system. This ER traverses the Golgi ribbon from one side to the other via cisternal openings. Microtubules form close, non-random associations with the cis Golgi, the ER, and endo-lysosomal compartments. Despite the dense packing of organelles in this Golgi region, Ϸ66% of the reconstructed volume is calculated to represent cytoplasmic matrix. We relate the intimacy of structural associations between organelles in the Golgi region, as quantified by spatial density analyses, to biochemical mechanisms for membrane trafficking and organellar communication in mammalian cells.},

Here we studied the molecular mechanism and function of the CHN-1/UFD-2 complex in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our data show that UFD-2 binding promotes the cooperation between CHN-1 and ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzymes by stabilizing the CHN-1 U-box dimer. The HSP-1 chaperone outcompetes UFD-2 for CHN-1 binding and promotes the auto-inhibited CHN-1 state by acting on the conserved position of the U-box domain. The interaction with UFD-2 enables CHN-1 to efficiently ubiquitinate S-Adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY-1), an enzyme crucial for lipid metabolism. Our results define the molecular mechanism underlying the synergistic cooperation of CHN-1 and UFD-2 in substrate ubiquitylation.},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.3390/cells9020261},
abstract ={Immunosenescence in monocytes has been shown to be associated with several biochemical and functional changes, including development of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which may be inhibited by klotho protein. To date, it was believed that SASP activation is associated with accumulating DNA damage. However, some literature data suggest that endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi stress pathways may be involved in SASP development. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of klotho protein in the regulation of immunosenescence-associated Golgi apparatus and ER stress response induced by bacterial antigens in monocytes. We provide evidence that initiation of immunosenescent-like phenotype in monocytes is accompanied by activation of CREB34L and TFE3 Golgi stress response and ATF6 and IRE1 endoplasmic reticulum stress response, while klotho overexpression prevents these changes. Further, these changes are followed by upregulated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, which final modification takes place exclusively in the Golgi apparatus. In conclusion, we provide for the first time evidence of klotho involvement in the crosstalk on the line ER-Golgi, which may, in turn, affect activation of SASP. This data may be useful for a novel potential target for therapy in age-related and chronic inflammatory conditions.},

abstract ={In eukaryotic cells, organelle-specific stress-response mechanisms are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The Golgi apparatus, an essential organelle of the secretory system, is the major site of protein modification and sorting within a cell and functions as a platform for spatially regulated signaling. Golgi homeostasis mechanisms that regulate organelle structure and ensure precise processing and localization of protein substrates remain poorly understood. Using a chemical biology strategy to induce protein unfolding, we uncover a Golgi-specific transcriptional response. An RNA-sequencing profile of this stress response compared with the current state-of-the-art Golgi stressors, nigericin and xyloside, demonstrates the enhanced precision of Golgi targeting achieved with our system. The data set further reveals previously uncharacterized genes that we find to be essential for Golgi structural integrity. These findings highlight the Golgi's ability to sense misfolded proteins and establish new aspects of Golgi autoregulation.},

abstract ={Lipidomics is of growing importance for clinical and biomedical research due to many associations between lipid metabolism and diseases. The discovery of these associations is facilitated by improved lipid identification and quantification. Sophisticated computational methods are advantageous for interpreting such large-scale data for understanding metabolic processes and their underlying (patho)mechanisms. To generate hypothesis about these mechanisms, the combination of metabolic networks and graph algorithms is a powerful option to pinpoint molecular disease drivers and their interactions. Here we present LINEX 2 (Lipid Network Explorer), a lipid network analysis framework that fuels biological interpretation of alterations in lipid compositions. By integrating lipid-metabolic reactions from public databases we generate dataset-specific lipid interaction networks. To aid interpretation of these networks we present an enrichment graph algorithm that infers changes in enzymatic activity in the context of their multispecificity from lipidomics data. Our inference method successfully recovered the MBOAT7 enzyme from knockout data. Furthermore, we mechanistically interpret lipidomic alterations of adipocytes in obesity by leveraging network enrichment and lipid moieties. We address the general lack of lipidomics data mining options to elucidate potential disease mechanisms and make lipidomics more clinically relevant.},

doi ={10.1111/j.1600-0854.2010.01114.x},
abstract ={The Golgi apparatus lies at the heart of the secretory pathway where it receives, modifies, and sorts protein cargo to the proper intracellular or extracellular location. Although this secretory function is highly conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom, the structure of the Golgi complex is arranged very differently among species. In particular, Golgi membranes in vertebrate cells are integrated into a single compact entity termed the Golgi ribbon that is normally localized in the perinuclear area and in close vicinity to the centrosomes. This organization poses a challenge for cell division when the single Golgi ribbon needs to be partitioned into the two daughter cells. To ensure faithful inheritance in the progeny, the Golgi ribbon is divided in three consecutive steps in mitosis, namely disassembly, partitioning, and reassembly. However, the structure of the Golgi ribbon is only present in higher animals and Golgi disassembly during mitosis is not ubiquitous in all organisms. Therefore, there must be unique reasons to build up the Golgi in this particular conformation and to preserve it over generations. In this review, we first highlight the diversity of the Golgi architecture in different organisms and revisit the concept of the Golgi ribbon. Following on, we discuss why the ribbon is needed and how it forms in vertebrate cells. Lastly, we conclude with likely purposes of mitotic ribbon disassembly and further propose mechanisms by which it regulates mitosis.},

title ={Nuclear lipid droplets and nuclear damage in Caenorhabditis elegans},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1009602},
abstract ={Fat stored in the form of lipid droplets has long been considered a defining characteristic of cytoplasm. However, recent studies have shown that nuclear lipid droplets occur in multiple cells and tissues, including in human patients with fatty liver disease. The function(s) of stored fat in the nucleus has not been determined, and it is possible that nuclear fat is beneficial in some situations. Conversely, nuclear lipid droplets might instead be deleterious by disrupting nuclear organization or triggering aggregation of hydrophobic proteins. We show here that nuclear lipid droplets occur normally in C. elegans intestinal cells and germ cells, but appear to be associated with damage only in the intestine. Lipid droplets in intestinal nuclei can be associated with novel bundles of microfilaments (nuclear actin) and membrane tubules that might have roles in damage repair. To increase the normal, low frequency of nuclear lipid droplets in wild-type animals, we used a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants with abnormally large or abundant nuclear lipid droplets. Genetic analysis and cloning of three such mutants showed that the genes encode the lipid regulator SEIP-1/seipin, the inner nuclear membrane protein NEMP-1/Nemp1/TMEM194A, and a component of COPI vesicles called COPA-1/α-COP. We present several lines of evidence that the nuclear lipid droplet phenotype of copa-1 mutants results from a defect in retrieving mislocalized membrane proteins that normally reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. The seip-1 mutant causes most germ cells to have nuclear lipid droplets, the largest of which occupy more than a third of the nuclear volume. Nevertheless, the nuclear lipid droplets do not trigger apoptosis, and the germ cells differentiate into gametes that produce viable, healthy progeny. Thus, our results suggest that nuclear lipid droplets are detrimental to intestinal nuclei, but have no obvious deleterious effect on germ nuclei.},

abstract ={Vesicles formed by the COPI complex function in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein b (PITPb), an essential protein that possesses phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) lipid transfer activity is known to localise to the Golgi and ER but its role in these membrane systems is not clear. To examine the function of PITPb at the Golgi-ER interface, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to knockdown PITPb protein expression in HeLa cells. Depletion of PITPb leads to a decrease in PtdIns(4)P levels, compaction of the Golgi complex and protection from brefeldin-Amediated dispersal to the ER. Using specific transport assays, we show that anterograde traffic is unaffected but that KDEL-receptordependent retrograde traffic is inhibited. This phenotype can be rescued by expression of wild-type PITPb but not by mutants defective in docking, PtdIns transfer and PtdCho transfer. These data demonstrate that the PtdIns and PtdCho exchange activity of PITPb is essential for COPI-mediated retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER.},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.1083/jcb.202004191},
abstract ={2014). However, these studies addressed the effect of depleting either only one of the two GORASP orthologues. In the mouse knockout of GORASP1 that failed to detect an obvious effect on Golgi stacking (Veenendaal et al., 2014), the levels of GORASP2 were unaffected, which raises the possibility of a functional redundancy. To address redundancy, Wang and colleagues used CRISPR-Cas9 to completely deplete GORASPs in HeLa and HEK293 cells, but these alterations led to a significant reduction (up to 75-80% of the control levels) of GM130 and golgin-45 proteins (Bekier et al., 2017). Fluorescence microscopy-based analysis with antibodies to GM130 and the late Golgi transmembrane protein TGN46 revealed that these membrane components were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm instead of localized at the Golgi as in control cells.

title ={Lipid-anchored proteasomes control membrane protein homeostasis},
year ={2024},
doi ={},
abstract ={Protein degradation in eukaryotic cells is mainly carried out by the 26S proteasome, a macromolecular complex not only present in the cytosol and nucleus but also associated with various membranes. How proteasomes are anchored to the membrane and the biological meaning thereof have been largely unknown in higher organisms. Here, we show that N-myristoylation of the Rpt2 subunit is a general mechanism for proteasome-membrane interaction. Loss of this modification in the Rpt2-G2A mutant cells leads to profound changes in the membrane-associated proteome, perturbs the endomembrane system, and undermines critical cellular processes such as cell adhesion, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and membrane protein trafficking. Rpt2 G2A/G2A homozygous mutation is embryonic lethal in mice and is sufficient to abolish tumor growth in a nude mice xenograft model. These findings have defined an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for maintaining membrane protein homeostasis and underscored the significance of compartmentalized protein degradation by myristoyl-anchored proteasomes in health and disease.},

doi ={10.1101/2023.12.20.572417},
abstract ={The physical microenvironment regulates cell behaviour. However, whether physical confinement rewires the subcellular localisation of organelles and affect metabolism is unknown. Proteomics analysis revealed that cellular confinement induces a strong enrichment of mitochondrial proteins within the nuclear compartment. High-resolution microscopy confirmed that mechanical cell confinement leads to a rapid relocalisation of mitochondria to the nuclear periphery. This nuclear-mitochondrial proximity is mediated by an endoplasmic reticulum-based net that entraps the mitochondria in an actin-dependent manner. Functionally, the mitochondrial proximity results in a nuclear ATP surge, which can be reverted by the pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial ATP production or via actin depolymerisation. Inhibition of the confinement-derived nuclear ATP surge reveals long-term effects on cell fitness which arise from alterations of chromatin states, delayed DNA damage repair, and impaired cell cycle progression. Together, our data describe a confinement-induced metabolic adaptation that is required to enable prompt DNA damage repair and cell cycle progression by allowing chromatin state transitions.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1101/2022.06.27.497668},
abstract ={Vitellogenins (VITs) are the most abundant proteins in adult hermaphrodite C. elegans. VITs are synthesized in the intestine, secreted to the pseudocoelom, matured into yolk proteins (YPs), and finally deposited in oocytes to support embryonic and larval development. How VITs are secreted out of the intestine remains unclear. In this study, we use immuno-electron microscopy (immuno-EM) to characterize the wild-type subcellular structures containing VITs or YPs. In the intestinal cells of young adult worms, we identify VITs along an exocytic pathway consisting of the rough ER, the Golgi, and the lipid bilayer bounded vesicles, which we call intestinal vitellogenin vesicles (VVs). This suggests that the classic exocytotic pathway mediates secretion of VITs from the intestine to the pseudocoelom. We also show that pseudocoelomic yolk patches (PYPs) are membrane-less and amorphous. The different VITs/YPs are packed as a mixture into the above structures. The size of VVs can vary with the VIT levels and the age of the worm. On adult day 2 (AD 2), intestinal VVs (~200 nm in diameter) are smaller than gonadal yolk organelles (YOs, ~500 nm in diameter). VVs, PYPs, and YOs share a uniform, medium electron density by conventional EM. The morphological profiles documented in this study can serve as a reference for future studies of VITs/YPs. Surveying the findings from this study and elsewhere, we review in the discussion the post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions of C. elegans VITs/YPs.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1083/jcb.202106100},
abstract ={ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) are small GTPases regulating membrane traffic in the secretory pathway. They are closely related and appear to have overlapping functions, regulators, and effectors. The functional specificity of individual Arfs and the extent of redundancy are still largely unknown. We addressed these questions by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic deletion of the human class I (Arf1/3) and class II (Arf4/5) Arfs, either individually or in combination. Most knockout cell lines were viable with slight growth defects only when lacking Arf1 or Arf4. However, Arf1+4 and Arf4+5 could not be deleted simultaneously. Class I Arfs are nonessential, and Arf4 alone is sufficient for viability. Upon Arf1 deletion, the Golgi was enlarged, and recruitment of vesicle coats decreased, confirming a major role of Arf1 in vesicle formation at the Golgi. Knockout of Arf4 caused secretion of ER-resident proteins, indicating specific defects in coatomer-dependent ER protein retrieval by KDEL receptors. The knockout cell lines will be useful tools to study other Arf-dependent processes. .},

Such interactions serve a wide range of cellular functions from regulating metabolic pathways to executing stress responses and coordinating organelle inheritance. The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in information on certain contact sites, mostly those involving the endoplasmic reticulum. However, despite its central role in the secretory pathway, the Golgi apparatus and its contact sites remain largely unexplored. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of Golgi contact sites and share our thoughts as to why Golgi contact sites are understudied. We also highlight what exciting future directions may exist in this emerging field.},

abstract ={The Golgi is a dynamic organelle whose correct assembly is crucial for cellular homeostasis. Perturbations in Golgi structure are associated with numerous disorders from neurodegeneration to cancer. However, whether and how dispersal of the Golgi apparatus is actively regulated under stress, and the consequences of Golgi dispersal, remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that 26S proteasomes are associated with the cytosolic surface of Golgi membranes to facilitate Golgi Apparatus-Related Degradation (GARD) and degradation of GM130 in response to Golgi stress. The degradation of GM130 is dependent on p97/VCP and 26S proteasomes, and required for Golgi dispersal. Finally, we show that perturbation of Golgi homeostasis induces cell death of multiple myeloma in vitro and in vivo, offering a therapeutic strategy for this malignancy. Taken together, this work reveals a mechanism of Golgi-localized proteasomal degradation, providing a functional link between proteostasis control and Golgi architecture, which may be critical in various secretion-related pathologies.},

title ={Ubiquitination drives COPI priming and Golgi SNARE localization},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.80911},
abstract ={Deciphering mechanisms controlling SNARE localization within the Golgi complex is crucial to understanding protein trafficking patterns within the secretory pathway. SNAREs are also thought to prime coatomer protein I (COPI) assembly to ensure incorporation of these essential cargoes into vesicles, but the regulation of these events is poorly understood. Here, we report roles for ubiquitin recognition by COPI in SNARE trafficking and in stabilizing interactions between Arf, COPI, and Golgi SNAREs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ability of COPI to bind ubiquitin, but not the dilysine motif, through its N-terminal WD repeat domain of β′-COP or through an unrelated ubiquitin-binding domain is essential for the proper localization of Golgi SNAREs Bet1 and Gos1. We find that COPI, the ArfGAP Glo3, and multiple Golgi SNAREs are ubiquitinated. Notably, the binding of Arf and COPI to Gos1 is markedly enhanced by ubiquitination of these components. Glo3 is proposed to prime COPI-SNARE interactions; however, Glo3 is not enriched in the ubiquitin-stabilized SNARE-Arf-COPI complex but is instead enriched with COPI complexes that lack SNAREs. These results support a new model for how posttranslational modifications drive COPI priming events crucial for Golgi SNARE localization. Editor's evaluation This article will be of interest for cell biologists focused on understanding membrane biology, trafficking, and protein ubiquitination, as well as yeast geneticists. The main finding of this paper is that non-degradative ubiquitination is an important mechanism driving COPI-dependent SNARE trafficking and localization.},

abstract ={Repurposing drugs as treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has drawn much attention. Beginning with sigma receptor ligands and expanding to other drugs from screening in the field, we became concerned that phospholipidosis was a shared mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of many repurposed drugs. For all of the 23 cationic amphiphilic drugs we tested, including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, amiodarone, and four others already in clinical trials, phospholipidosis was monotonically correlated with antiviral efficacy. Conversely, drugs active against the same targets that did not induce phospholipidosis were not antiviral. Phospholipidosis depends on the physicochemical properties of drugs and does not reflect specific targetbased activities-rather, it may be considered a toxic confound in early drug discovery. Early detection of phospholipidosis could eliminate these artifacts, enabling a focus on molecules with therapeutic potential.},

title ={Origin of gradients in lipid density and surface tension between connected lipid droplet and bilayer},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1016/j.bpj.2021.11.022},
abstract ={We combined theory and experiments to depict physical parameters modulating the phospholipid (PL) density and tension equilibrium between a bilayer and an oil droplet in contiguity. This situation is encountered during a neutral lipid (NL) droplet formation in the endoplasmic reticulum. We set up macroscopic and microscopic models to uncover free parameters and the origin of molecular interactions controlling the PL densities of the droplet monolayer and the bilayer. The established physical laws and predictions agreed with experiments performed with droplet-embedded vesicles. We found that the droplet monolayer is always by a few percent ($10%) less packed with PLs than the bilayer. Such a density gradient arises from PL-NL interactions on the droplet, which are lower than PL-PL trans interactions in the bilayer, i.e., interactions between PLs belonging to different leaflets of the bilayer. Finally, despite the pseudo-surface tension for the water/PL acyl chains in the bilayer being higher than the water/NL surface tension, the droplet monolayer always has a higher surface tension than the bilayer because of its lower PL density. Thus, a PL density gradient is mandatory to maintain the mechanical and thermodynamic equilibrium of the droplet-bilayer continuity. Our study sheds light on the origin of the molecular interactions responsible for the unique surface properties of lipid droplets compared with cellular bilayer membranes.},

doi ={10.1021/acs.chemrev.3c00608},
abstract ={It is well-known that aqueous dispersions of phospholipids spontaneously assemble into bilayer structures. These structures have numerous applications across chemistry and materials science and form the fundamental structural unit of the biological membrane. The particular environment of the lipid bilayer, with a water-poor low dielectric core surrounded by a more polar and better hydrated interfacial region, gives the membrane particular biophysical and physicochemical properties and presents a unique environment for chemical reactions to occur. Many different types of molecule spanning a range of sizes, from dissolved gases through small organics to proteins, are able to interact with membranes and promote chemical changes to lipids that subsequently affect the physicochemical properties of the bilayer. This Review describes the chemical reactivity exhibited by lipids in their membrane form, with an emphasis on conditions where the lipids are well hydrated in the form of bilayers. Key topics include the following: lytic reactions of glyceryl esters, including hydrolysis, aminolysis, and transesterification; oxidation reactions of alkenes in unsaturated fatty acids and sterols, including autoxidation and oxidation by singlet oxygen; reactivity of headgroups, particularly with reactive carbonyl species; and E/Z isomerization of alkenes. The consequences of reactivity for biological activity and biophysical properties are also discussed. CONTENTS},

title ={Membrane phospholipid alteration causes chronic ER stress through early degradation of homeostatic ER-resident proteins},
year ={2019},
doi ={10.1038/s41598-019-45020-6},
abstract ={phospholipid homeostasis in biological membranes is essential to maintain functions of organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum. phospholipid perturbation has been associated to cellular stress responses. However, in most cases, the implication of membrane lipid changes to homeostatic cellular response has not been clearly defined. Previously, we reported that Saccharomyces cerevisiae adapts to lipid bilayer stress by upregulating several protein quality control pathways such as the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (eRAD) pathway and the unfolded protein response (UpR). surprisingly, we observed certain eR-resident transmembrane proteins, which form part of the UpR programme, to be destabilised under lipid bilayer stress. Among these, the protein translocon subunit Sbh1 was prematurely degraded by membrane stiffening at the ER. Moreover, our findings suggest that the Doa10 complex recognises free Sbh1 that becomes increasingly accessible during lipid bilayer stress, perhaps due to the change in eR membrane properties. premature removal of key eR-resident transmembrane proteins might be an underlying cause of chronic eR stress as a result of lipid bilayer stress.},

title ={Sphingomyelin metabolism controls the shape and function of the Golgi cisternae},
year ={2017},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.24603.001},
abstract ={The flat Golgi cisterna is a highly conserved feature of eukaryotic cells, but how is this morphology achieved and is it related to its function in cargo sorting and export? A physical model of cisterna morphology led us to propose that sphingomyelin (SM) metabolism at the trans-Golgi membranes in mammalian cells essentially controls the structural features of a Golgi cisterna by regulating its association to curvature-generating proteins. An experimental test of this hypothesis revealed that affecting SM homeostasis converted flat cisternae into highly curled membranes with a concomitant dissociation of membrane curvature-generating proteins. These data lend support to our hypothesis that SM metabolism controls the structural organization of a Golgi cisterna. Together with our previously presented role of SM in controlling the location of proteins involved in glycosylation and vesicle formation, our data reveal the significance of SM metabolism in the structural organization and function of Golgi cisternae.},

title ={Staufen1 regulates diverse classes of mammalian transcripts},
year ={2007},
doi ={10.1038/sj.emboj.7601712},
abstract ={It is currently unknown how extensively the doublestranded RNA-binding protein Staufen (Stau)1 is utilized by mammalian cells to regulate gene expression. To date, Stau1 binding to the 3 0-untranslated region (3 0-UTR) of ADP ribosylation factor (ARF)1 mRNA has been shown to target ARF1 mRNA for Stau1-mediated mRNA decay (SMD). ARF1 SMD depends on translation and recruitment of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay factor Upf1 to the ARF1 3 0-UTR by Stau1. Here, we demonstrate that Stau1 binds to a complex structure within the ARF1 3 0-UTR. We also use microarrays to show that 1.1 and 1.0% of the 11 569 HeLa-cell transcripts that were analyzed are upregulated and downregulated, respectively, at least twofold upon Stau1 depletion in three independently performed experiments. We localize the Stau1 binding site to the 3 0-UTR of four mRNAs that we define as natural SMD targets. Additionally, we provide evidence that the efficiency of SMD increases during the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts to myotubes. We propose that Stau1 influences the expression of a wide variety of physiologic transcripts and metabolic pathways.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1038/s41557-023-01214-0},
abstract ={Cellular membranes contain numerous lipid species, and efforts to understand the biological functions of individual lipids have been stymied by a lack of approaches for controlled modulation of membrane composition in situ. Here we present a strategy for editing phospholipids, the most abundant lipids in biological membranes. Our membrane editor is based on a bacterial phospholipase D (PLD), which exchanges phospholipid head groups through hydrolysis or transphosphatidylation of phosphatidylcholine with water or exogenous alcohols. Exploiting activity-dependent directed enzyme evolution in mammalian cells, we have developed and structurally characterized a family of 'superPLDs' with up to a 100-fold enhancement in intracellular activity. We demonstrate the utility of superPLDs for both optogenetics-enabled editing of phospholipids within specific organelle membranes in live cells and biocatalytic synthesis of natural and unnatural designer phospholipids in vitro. Beyond the superPLDs, activity-based directed enzyme evolution in mammalian cells is a generalizable approach to engineer additional chemoenzymatic biomolecule editors.},

title ={Disruption of hepatic one-carbon metabolism impairs mitochondrial function and enhances macrophage activity in methionine–choline-deficient mice},
year ={2020},
doi ={10.1016/j.jnutbio.2020.108381},
abstract ={One-carbon metabolism is a collection of metabolic cycles that supports methylation and provides one-carbon bound folates for the de novo synthesis purine and thymidine nucleotides. The methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine to form choline has been extensively studied in the context of fatty liver disease. However, the role of one-carbon metabolism in supporting nucleotide synthesis during liver damage has not been addressed. The objective of this study is to determine how the disruption of one-carbon metabolism influences nucleotide metabolism in the liver after dietary methionine and choline restriction. Mice (n=8) were fed a methionine-choline-deficient or control diet for 3 weeks. We treated mice with the compound alloxazine (0.5 mg/kg), a known adenosine receptor antagonist, every second day during the final week of feeding to probe the function of adenosine signaling during liver damage. We found that concentrations of several hepatic nucleotides were significantly lower in methionine-and choline-deficient mice vs. controls (adenine: 13.9±0.7 vs. 10.1±0.6, guanine: 1.8±0.1 vs. 1.4±0.1, thymidine: 0.0122±0.0027 vs. 0.0059±0.0027 nmol/mg dry tissue). Treatment of alloxazine caused a specific decrease thymidine nucleotides, decrease in mitochondrial content in the liver and exacerbation of steatohepatitis as shown by the increased hepatic lipid content and altered macrophage morphology. This study demonstrates a role for one-carbon metabolism in supporting de novo nucleotide synthesis and mitochondrial function during liver damage.},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-019-14038-9},
abstract ={The Golgi is a dynamic organelle whose correct assembly is crucial for cellular homeostasis. Perturbations in Golgi structure are associated with numerous disorders from neurodegeneration to cancer. However, whether and how dispersal of the Golgi apparatus is actively regulated under stress, and the consequences of Golgi dispersal, remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that 26S proteasomes are associated with the cytosolic surface of Golgi membranes to facilitate Golgi Apparatus-Related Degradation (GARD) and degradation of GM130 in response to Golgi stress. The degradation of GM130 is dependent on p97/VCP and 26S proteasomes, and required for Golgi dispersal. Finally, we show that perturbation of Golgi homeostasis induces cell death of multiple myeloma in vitro and in vivo, offering a therapeutic strategy for this malignancy. Taken together, this work reveals a mechanism of Golgi-localized proteasomal degradation, providing a functional link between proteostasis control and Golgi architecture, which may be critical in various secretion-related pathologies.},

abstract ={Recent advances in single-cell genomics and transcriptomics technologies have transformed our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in growth, development, ageing, and disease; however, methods for single-cell lipidomics have comparatively lagged behind in development. We have developed a method for the detection and quantification of a wide range of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin species from single cells that combines fluorescence-assisted cell sorting with automated chip-based nanoESI and shotgun lipidomics. We show herein that our method is capable of quantifying more than 50 different phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin species from single cells and can easily distinguish between cells of different lineages or cells treated with exogenous fatty acids. Moreover, our method can detect more subtle differences in the lipidome between cell lines of the same cancer type. Our approach can be run in parallel with other single-cell technologies to deliver near-complete, high-throughput multi-omics data on cells with a similar phenotype and has the capacity to significantly advance our current knowledge on cellular heterogeneity.},
