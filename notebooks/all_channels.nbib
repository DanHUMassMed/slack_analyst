year ={2023},
doi ={10.1083/jcb.202304026},
abstract ={Lipid composition determines organelle identity; however, whether the lipid composition of the inner nuclear membrane (INM) domain of the ER contributes to its identity is not known. Here, we show that the INM lipid environment of animal cells is under local control by CTDNEP1, the master regulator of the phosphatidic acid phosphatase lipin 1. Loss of CTDNEP1 reduces association of an INM-specific diacylglycerol (DAG) biosensor and results in a decreased percentage of polyunsaturated containing DAG species. Alterations in DAG metabolism impact the levels of the resident INM protein Sun2, which is under local proteasomal regulation. We identify a lipid-binding amphipathic helix (AH) in the nucleoplasmic domain of Sun2 that prefers membrane packing defects. INM dissociation of the Sun2 AH is linked to its proteasomal degradation. We suggest that direct lipid-protein interactions contribute to sculpting the INM proteome and that INM identity is adaptable to lipid metabolism, which has broad implications on disease mechanisms associated with the nuclear envelope. .},

year ={2019},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.46595.001},
abstract ={The unfolded protein response (UPR) detects and restores deficits in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding capacity. Ceapins specifically inhibit the UPR sensor ATF6a, an ERtethered transcription factor, by retaining it at the ER through an unknown mechanism. Our genome-wide CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen reveals that Ceapins function is completely dependent on the ABCD3 peroxisomal transporter. Proteomics studies establish that ABCD3 physically associates with ER-resident ATF6a in cells and in vitro in a Ceapin-dependent manner. Ceapins induce the neomorphic association of ER and peroxisomes by directly tethering the cytosolic domain of ATF6a to ABCD3's transmembrane regions without inhibiting or depending on ABCD3 transporter activity. Thus, our studies reveal that Ceapins function by chemical-induced misdirection which explains their remarkable specificity and opens up new mechanistic routes for drug development and synthetic biology.},

abstract ={Phosphatidylcholine, the major phospholipid of very low density lipoproteins, is packaged with triglyceride in the Golgi cisternae. CTP-phosphocholine cytidyltransferase and CDP-choline phosphotransferase activities of Golgi subfractions were higher than those of rough or smooth microsomes measured under the same conditions, indicating that phosphatidylcholine synthesis can occur in Golgi membranes. Consistent with this, the specific activity of phosphatidylcholine of Golgi membranes rose more rapidly than that of rough and smooth microsomes after injection of ["C]choline in vivo. The specific activity of the Golgi content phosphatidylcholine (nonmembrane fraction) remained low. The S-adenosylmethionine phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase activity of Golgi subfractions was also higher than that of rough or smooth microsomes. After injection of ['H]methyl-labeled methionine in vivo, the specific activity of phosphatidylcholine of the Golgi membranes rose in parallel with that of the rough and smooth microsomes. The specific activity of the Golgi content phosphatidylcholine rose above that of the Golgi membranes and exhibited a different pattern, suggesting that this pathway may selectively label phosphatidylcholine which is secreted as lipoproteins. 8 These observations indicate that the Golgi membranes have the enzymes necessary for synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, and incorporation of lipid precursors indicates that synthesis of phosphatidylcholine by Golgi membranes occurs in vivo.-Higgins, J.

title ={ADP-ribosylation factor and phosphatidic acid levels in Golgi membranes during budding of coatomer-coated vesicles},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={The finding that ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) can activate phospholipase D has led to debate as to whether ARF recruits coat proteins through direct binding or indirectly by catalytically increasing phosphatidic acid production. Here we test critical aspects of these hypotheses. We find that Golgi membrane phosphatidic acid levels do not rise-in fact they decline-during cell-free budding reactions. We confirm that the level of membrane-bound ARF can be substantially reduced without compromising coat assembly [Ktistakis, N. T., Brown, H. A., Waters, M. G., Sternweis, P. C. & Roth, M. G. (1996) J. Cell Biol. 134, 295-306], but find that under all conditions, ARF is present on the Golgi membrane in molar excess over bound coatomer. These results do not support the possibility that the activation of coat assembly by ARF is purely catalytic, and they are consistent with ARF forming direct interactions with coatomer. We suggest that ARF, like many other G proteins, is a multifunctional protein with roles in trafficking and phospholipid signaling.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1016/j.neuron.2022.04.020},
abstract ={The defining evolutionary feature of eukaryotic cells is the emergence of membrane-bound organelles. Compartmentalization allows each organelle to maintain a spatially, physically, and chemically distinct environment, which greatly bolsters individual organelle function. However, the activities of each organelle must be balanced and are interdependent for cellular homeostasis. Therefore, properly regulated interactions between organelles, either physically or functionally, remain critical for overall cellular health and behavior. In particular, neuronal homeostasis depends heavily on the proper regulation of organelle function and cross talk, and deficits in these functions are frequently associated with diseases. In this review, we examine the emerging role of organelle contacts in neurological diseases and discuss how the disruption of contacts contributes to disease pathogenesis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and regulation of organelle contacts will broaden our knowledge of their role in health and disease, laying the groundwork for the development of new therapies targeting interorganelle cross talk and function.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad351},
abstract ={The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-embedded transcription factors, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), master regulators of lipid biosynthesis, are transported to the Golgi for proteolytic activation to tune cellular cholesterol levels and regulate lipogenesis. However, mechanisms by which the cell responds to the levels of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids remain underexplored. Here, we show that RHBDL4/RHBDD1, a rhomboid family protease, directly cleaves SREBP-1c at the ER. The p97/VCP, AAA-ATPase complex then acts as an auxiliary segregase to extract the remaining ER-embedded fragment of SREBP-1c. Importantly, the enzymatic activity of RHBDL4 is enhanced by saturated fatty acids (SFAs) but inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Genetic deletion of RHBDL4 in mice fed on a Western diet enriched in SFAs and cholesterol prevented SREBP-1c from inducing genes for lipogenesis, particularly for synthesis and incorporation of PUFAs, and secretion of lipoproteins. The RHBDL4-SREBP-1c pathway reveals a regulatory system for monitoring fatty acid composition and maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis.},

doi ={10.1074/jbc.M111.261800},
abstract ={Newly synthesized proteins and lipids are transported in vesicular carriers along the secretory pathway. Arfs (ADP-ribosylation factors), a family of highly conserved GTPases within the Ras superfamily, control recruitment of molecular coats to membranes, the initial step of coated vesicle biogenesis. Arf1 and coatomer constitute the minimal cytosolic machinery leading to COPI vesicle formation from Golgi membranes. Although some functional redundancies have been suggested, other Arf isoforms have been poorly analyzed in this context. In this study, we found that Arf1, Arf4, and Arf5, but not Arf3 and Arf6, associate with COPI vesicles generated in vitro from Golgi membranes and purified cytosol. Using recombinant myristoylated proteins, we show that Arf1, Arf4, and Arf5 each support COPI vesicle formation individually. Unexpectedly, we found that Arf3 could also mediate vesicle biogenesis. However, Arf3 was excluded from the vesicle fraction in the presence of the other isoforms, highlighting a functional competition between the different Arf members.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1016/j.bpj.2021.11.022},
abstract ={We combined theory and experiments to depict physical parameters modulating the phospholipid (PL) density and tension equilibrium between a bilayer and an oil droplet in contiguity. This situation is encountered during a neutral lipid (NL) droplet formation in the endoplasmic reticulum. We set up macroscopic and microscopic models to uncover free parameters and the origin of molecular interactions controlling the PL densities of the droplet monolayer and the bilayer. The established physical laws and predictions agreed with experiments performed with droplet-embedded vesicles. We found that the droplet monolayer is always by a few percent ($10%) less packed with PLs than the bilayer. Such a density gradient arises from PL-NL interactions on the droplet, which are lower than PL-PL trans interactions in the bilayer, i.e., interactions between PLs belonging to different leaflets of the bilayer. Finally, despite the pseudo-surface tension for the water/PL acyl chains in the bilayer being higher than the water/NL surface tension, the droplet monolayer always has a higher surface tension than the bilayer because of its lower PL density. Thus, a PL density gradient is mandatory to maintain the mechanical and thermodynamic equilibrium of the droplet-bilayer continuity. Our study sheds light on the origin of the molecular interactions responsible for the unique surface properties of lipid droplets compared with cellular bilayer membranes.},

doi ={10.1038/s41467-022-28469-4},
abstract ={As a major risk factor to human health, obesity presents a massive burden to people and society. Interestingly, the obese status of parents can cause progeny's lipid accumulation through epigenetic inheritance in multiple species. To date, many questions remain as to how lipid accumulation leads to signals that are transmitted across generations. In this study, we establish a nematode model of C. elegans raised on a high-fat diet (HFD) that leads to measurable lipid accumulation, which can transmit the lipid accumulation signal to their multigenerational progeny. Using this model, we find that transcription factors DAF-16/ FOXO and SBP-1/SREBP, nuclear receptors NHR-49 and NHR-80, and delta-9 desaturases (fat-5, fat-6, and fat-7) are required for transgenerational lipid accumulation. Additionally, histone H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks lipid metabolism genes and increases their transcription response to multigenerational obesogenic effects. In summary, this study establishes an interaction between a network of lipid metabolic genes and chromatin modifications, which work together to achieve transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of obesogenic effects.},

doi ={10.1091/mbc.E23-07-0283)},
abstract ={Arf GTPases are central regulators of the Golgi complex, which serves as the nexus of membrane-trafficking pathways in eukaryotic cells. Arf proteins recruit dozens of effectors to modify membranes, sort cargos, and create and tether transport vesicles, and are therefore essential for orchestrating Golgi trafficking. The regulation of Arf activity is controlled by the action of Arf-GEFs which activate via nucleotide exchange, and Arf-GAPs which inactivate via nucleotide hydrolysis. The localization dynamics of Arf GTPases and their Arf-GAPs during Golgi maturation have not been reported. Here we use the budding yeast model to examine the temporal localization of the Golgi Arf-GAPs. We also determine the mechanisms used by the Arf-GAP Age2 to localize to the Golgi. We find that the catalytic activity of Age2 and a conserved sequence in the unstructured C-terminal domain of Age2 are both required for Golgi localization. This sequence is predicted to form an amphipathic helix and mediates direct binding of Age2 to membranes in vitro. We also report the development of a probe for sensing active Arf1 in living cells and use this probe to characterize the temporal dynamics of Arf1 during Golgi maturation.},

year ={2005},
doi ={10.1091/mbc.E04},
abstract ={The ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) are six proteins within the larger Arf family and Ras superfamily that regulate membrane traffic. Arfs all share numerous biochemical activities and have very similar specific activities. The use of dominant mutants and brefeldin A has been important to the discovery of the cellular functions of Arfs but lack specificity between Arf isoforms. We developed small interference RNA constructs capable of specific depletion of each of the cytoplasmic human Arfs to examine the specificity of Arfs in live cells. No single Arf was required for any step of membrane traffic examined in HeLa cells. However, every combination of the double knockdowns of Arf1, Arf3, Arf4, and Arf5 yielded a distinct pattern of defects in secretory and endocytic traffic, demonstrating clear specificity for Arfs at multiple steps. These results suggest that the cooperation of two Arfs at the same site may be a general feature of Arf signaling and provide candidates at several cellular locations that when paired with data on the localization of the many different Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factors, Arf GTPase activating proteins, and effectors will aid in the description of the mechanisms of specificity in this highly conserved and primordial family of regulatory GTPases.},

abstract ={How can anterograde membrane trafficking be modulated by physiological cues? A screen of Golgi-associated proteins revealed that the ARF-GEF GBF1 can selectively modulate the ER-Golgi trafficking of prohaemostatic von Willebrand factor (VWF) and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in human endothelial cells and in mouse fibroblasts. The relationship between levels of GBF1 and the trafficking of VWF into forming secretory granules confirmed GBF1 is a limiting factor in this process. Further, GBF1 activation by AMPK couples its control of anterograde trafficking to physiological cues; levels of glucose control GBF1 activation in turn modulating VWF trafficking into secretory granules. GBF1 modulates both ER and TGN exit, the latter dramatically affecting the size of the VWF storage organelles, thereby influencing the hemostatic capacity of the endothelium. The role of AMPK as a central integrating element of cellular pathways with intra-and extra-cellular cues can now be extended to modulation of the anterograde secretory pathway.},

Caenorhabditis elegans eat bacteria, which consist of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins that are broken down during digestion into fatty acids, simple sugars, and amino acid precursors. With these nutrients, C. elegans synthesizes a wide range of metabolites that are required for development and behavior. In this review, we outline lipid and carbohydrate structures as well as biosynthesis and breakdown pathways that have been characterized in C. elegans. We bring attention to functional studies using mutant strains that reveal physiological roles for specific lipids and carbohydrates during development, aging, and adaptation to changing environmental conditions.},

doi ={10.1371/journal.pbio.3001051},
abstract ={Coordination of cell growth is essential for the development of the brain, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of glial and neuronal size are poorly understood. To investigate the mechanisms involved in glial size regulation, we used Caenorhabditis elegans amphid sheath (AMsh) glia as a model and show that a conserved cis-Golgi membrane protein eas-1/GOLT1B negatively regulates glial growth. We found that eas-1 inhibits a conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase rnf-145/RNF145, which, in turn, promotes nuclear activation of sbp-1/ SREBP, a key regulator of sterol and fatty acid synthesis, to restrict cell growth. At early developmental stages, rnf-145 in the cis-Golgi network inhibits sbp-1 activation to promote the growth of glia, and when animals reach the adult stage, this inhibition is released through an eas-1-dependent shuttling of rnf-145 from the cis-Golgi to the trans-Golgi network to stop glial growth. Furthermore, we identified long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as downstream products of the eas-1-rnf-145-sbp-1 pathway that functions to prevent the overgrowth of glia. Together, our findings reveal a novel and potentially conserved mechanism underlying glial size control.},

abstract ={In vitro experiments have shown that GRASP65 (GORASP1) and GRASP55 (GORASP2) proteins function in stacking Golgi cisternae. However, in vivo depletion of GORASPs in metazoans has given equivocal results. We have generated a mouse lacking both GORASPs and find that Golgi cisternae remained stacked. However, the stacks are disconnected laterally from each other, and the cisternal cross-sectional diameters are significantly reduced compared with their normal counterparts. These data support earlier findings on the role of GORASPs in linking stacks, and we suggest that unlinking of stacks likely affects dynamic control of COPI budding and vesicle fusion at the rims. The net result is that cisternal cores remain stacked, but cisternal diameter is reduced by rim consumption. .},

title ={An SPNS1-dependent lysosomal lipid transport pathway that enables cell survival under choline limitation},

doi ={},
abstract ={Lysosomes degrade macromolecules and recycle their nutrient content to support cell function and survival. However, the machineries involved in lysosomal recycling of many nutrients remain to be discovered, with a notable example being choline, an essential metabolite liberated via lipid degradation. Here, we engineered metabolic dependency on lysosome-derived choline in pancreatic cancer cells to perform an endolysosomefocused CRISPR-Cas9 screen for genes mediating lysosomal choline recycling. We identified the orphan lysosomal transmembrane protein SPNS1 as critical for cell survival under choline limitation. SPNS1 loss leads to intralysosomal accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE). Mechanistically, we reveal that SPNS1 is a proton gradient-dependent transporter of LPC species from the lysosome for their re-esterification into phosphatidylcholine in the cytosol. Last, we establish that LPC efflux by SPNS1 is required for cell survival under choline limitation. Collectively, our work defines a lysosomal phospholipid salvage pathway that is essential under nutrient limitation and, more broadly, provides a robust platform to deorphan lysosomal gene function.},

title ={Site-specific phosphorylations of the Arf activator GBF1 differentially regulate GBF1 function in Golgi homeostasis and secretion versus cytokinesis},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1038/s41598-023-40705-5},
abstract ={Diverse cellular processes, including membrane traffic, lipid homeostasis, cytokinesis, mitochondrial positioning, and cell motility are critically dependent on the Sec7 domain guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1. Yet, how the participation of GBF1 in a particular cellular function is regulated is unknown. Here, we show that the phosphorylation of specific highly conserved serine and tyrosine residues within the N-terminal domain of GBF1 differentially regulates its function in maintaining Golgi homeostasis and facilitating secretion versus its role in cytokinesis. Specifically, GBF1 mutants containing single amino acid substitutions that mimic a stably phosphorylated S233, S371, Y377, and Y515 or the S233A mutant that can't be phosphorylated are fully able to maintain Golgi architecture and support cargo traffic through the secretory pathway when assessed in multiple functional assays. However, the same mutants cause multi-nucleation when expressed in cells, and appear to inhibit the progression through mitosis and the resolution of cytokinetic bridges. Thus, GBF1 participates in distinct interactive networks when mediating Golgi homeostasis and secretion versus facilitating cytokinesis, and GBF1 integration into such networks is differentially regulated by the phosphorylation of specific GBF1 residues. Cellular homeostasis depends on tightly controlled circuits that engage and coordinate different processes in response to internal and external cues. The integration of cellular metabolic, genetic, and physiological/biochemical state is continuously monitored and relayed to each other for system-wide synchronization. Distinct checkpoints and control mechanisms have evolved to ensure that processes are coordinated in time and space. The secretory pathway, composed of a number of distinct compartments, is tightly regulated to ensure a compensatory anterograde and recycling traffic of membrane and select proteins to ensure continuous transport. One of the key regulators of the secretory pathway are the small GTPases of the Arf superfamily that facilitate traffic at the ER-Golgi interface 1-5. Arfs are essential to recruit the heptameric coatomer coat complexes to Golgi membranes to form COPI vesicles that recycle proteins and membrane from the Golgi to the ER 6-9. All Arfs cycle between GDP-and GTP-bound states and are functional and membrane-associated only when in their GTP-bound (active) state 10. The GDP/GTP exchange is kinetically unfavorable (to prevent spurious Arf activation) and requires an enzyme, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to catalyze the displacement of the GDP, thus allowing the binding of the activating GTP to the Arf. The GEF responsible for COPI vesicle formation is the Golgi-Specific Brefeldin A Resistance Factor 1 (GBF1), which localizes to the compartments at the ER-Golgi interface, including ER exit sites, ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC) and the Golgi 11,12. GBF1 is absolutely essential to activate Arfs required to maintain the architecture and function of the secretory pathway, and the disruption of GBF1 activity with the Brefeldin A (BFA) fungal metabolite or the depletion of cellular GBF1 by RNAi causes Golgi collapse into the ER and inhibits secretion 11,13-16 .},

The Golgi is disassembled after various cellular stresses, and we hypothesize that Golgi disassembly activates a stress signaling pathway. This pathway would function to correct the stress if possible, with irreparable stress resulting in apoptosis. Neurons appear to be particularly sensitive to Golgi stress; early disassembly of the organelle correlates with many neurodegenerative diseases.

title ={Anionic phospholipids determine G protein coupling selectivity at distinct subcellular membrane compartments},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.08.31.555797},
abstract ={G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activate different signaling pathways through coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins consisting of four types of G alpha (Gα) subunits and the beta gamma (bg) subunits. The C-terminal regions of Gα proteins is thought to determine coupling selectivity. However, there are several reports indicating that some receptors are promiscuous and can couple to multiple Gα proteins. The precise mechanism promoting promiscuous coupling is not fully understood. Here we show that anionic phospholipids such as phosphoinositide 4,5 bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) promote electrostatic interactions between anionic lipid head groups and positively charged amino acids in the transmembrane 4 (TM4) region of beta adrenergic receptors (βARs) to prime receptor coupling to the cognate Gαs and non-cognate Gαi proteins. The promiscuous coupling can only occur at the plasma membrane, a membrane compartment enriched in PI(4,5)P2, while receptors only couple to cognate Gαs proteins in compartments that are enriched in less negatively charged phosphoinositides such PI4P at the Golgi membranes. We took advantage of the rapamycin dimerization system to rapidly and inducibly deplete PI(4,5)P2 by recruiting a phosphatase to the plasma membrane and found that in the absence of anionic phospholipids, βARs couple only to their cognate Gαs protein. Finally, we found that mutating βARs PI(4,5)P2 binding motifs or depleting PI(4,5)P2 results in enhanced βARs-mediated cAMP response. Together, these findings reveal a role for anionic phosphoinositides in regulating GPCR activity at different subcellular compartments.},

doi ={10.1091/mbc.E08},
abstract ={Despite extensive work on ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) 1 at the Golgi complex, the functions of Arf2-5 in the secretory pathway, or for that of any Arf at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) remain uncharacterized. Here, we examined the recruitment of fluorescently tagged Arf1,-3,-4, and-5 onto peripheral ERGIC. Live cell imaging detected Arfs on peripheral puncta that also contained Golgi-specific brefeldin A (BFA) resistance factor (GBF) 1 and the ERGIC marker p58. Unexpectedly, BFA did not promote corecruitment of Arfs with GBF1 either at the Golgi complex or the ERGIC, but it uncovered striking differences between Arf1,3 and Arf4,5. Although Arf1,3 quickly dissociated from all endomembranes after BFA addition, Arf4,5 persisted on ERGIC structures, even after redistribution of GBF1 to separate compartments. The GDP-arrested Arf4(T31N) mutant localized to the ERGIC, even with BFA and Exo1 present. In addtion, loss of Arf ⅐ GTP after treatment with Exo1 caused rapid release of all Arfs from the Golgi complex and led to GBF1 accumulation on both Golgi and ERGIC membranes. Our results demonstrate that GDP-bound Arf4,5 associate with ERGIC membranes through binding sites distinct from those responsible for GBF1 recruitment. Furthermore, they provide the first evidence that GBF1 accumulation on membranes may be caused by loss of Arf ⅐ GTP, rather than the formation of an Arf ⅐ GDP ⅐ BFA ⅐ GBF1 complex.},

Global profiling of fatty acylated proteins via click chemistry further revealed acylation specificity at the individual protein level.

For instance, how can cells control the diverse patterns of glycosylation of various secretory proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi in an orderly manner with high accuracy? Here, we introduce the novel concept of organelle zones as a solution; each organelle has functionally distinct zones, and zones in different organelles closely interact each other in order to perform complex cellular functions. This Copernican Revolution from organelle biology to organelle zone biology will drastically change and advance our thoughts about cells.},

title ={An antisteatosis response regulated by oleic acid through lipid droplet-mediated ERAD enhancement},
year ={2024},
doi ={},
abstract ={Although excessive lipid accumulation is a hallmark of obesity-related pathologies, some lipids are beneficial. Oleic acid (OA), the most abundant monounsaturated fatty acid (FA), promotes health and longevity. Here, we show that OA benefits Caenorhabditis elegans by activating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transcription factor SKN-1A (Nrf1/NFE2L1) in a lipid homeostasis response. SKN-1A/Nrf1 is cleared from the ER by the ERassociated degradation (ERAD) machinery and stabilized when proteasome activity is low and canonically maintains proteasome homeostasis. Unexpectedly, OA increases nuclear SKN-1A levels independently of proteasome activity, through lipid droplet-dependent enhancement of ERAD. In turn, SKN-1A reduces steatosis by reshaping the lipid metabolism transcriptome and mediates longevity from OA provided through endogenous accumulation, reduced H3K4 trimethylation, or dietary supplementation. Our findings reveal an unexpected mechanism of FA signal transduction, as well as a lipid homeostasis pathway that provides strategies for opposing steatosis and aging, and may mediate some benefits of the OA-rich Mediterranean diet.},

doi ={10.1091/mbc.E21-02-0069)},
abstract ={Proper Golgi complex function depends on the activity of Arf1, a GTPase whose effectors assemble and transport outgoing vesicles. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) generated at the Golgi by the conserved PI 4-kinase Pik1 (PI4KIIIβ) is also essential for Golgi function, although its precise roles in vesicle formation are less clear. Arf1 has been reported to regulate PI4P production, but whether Pik1 is a direct Arf1 effector is not established. Using a combination of live-cell time-lapse imaging analyses, acute PI4P depletion experiments, and in vitro protein-protein interaction assays on Golgi-mimetic membranes, we present evidence for a model in which Arf1 initiates the final stages of Golgi maturation by tightly controlling PI4P production through direct recruitment of the Pik1-Frq1 PI4-kinase complex. This PI4P serves as a critical signal for AP-1 and secretory vesicle formation, the final events at maturing Golgi compartments. This work therefore establishes the regulatory and temporal context surrounding Golgi PI4P production and its precise roles in Golgi maturation.},

doi ={10.1038/s41598-022-05340-6},
abstract ={Challenges from environmental stressors have a profound impact on many life-history traits of an organism, including reproductive strategy. Examples across multiple taxa have demonstrated that maternal reproductive investment resulting from stress can improve offspring survival; a form of matricidal provisioning when death appears imminent is known as terminal investment. Here we report a reproductive response in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans upon exposure to acute cold shock at 2 °C, whereby vitellogenic lipid movement from the soma to the germline appears to be massively upregulated at the expense of parental survival. This response is dependent on functional TAX-2; TAX-4 cGMP-gated channels that are part of canonical thermosensory mechanisms in worms and can be prevented in the presence of activated SKN-1/Nrf2, the master stress regulator. Increased maternal provisioning promotes improved embryonic cold shock survival, which is notably suppressed in animals with impaired vitellogenesis. These findings suggest that cold shock in C. elegans triggers terminal investment to promote progeny fitness at the expense of parental survival and may serve as a tractable model for future studies of stress-induced progeny plasticity.},

abstract ={The realization that the meticulous organization of cellular organelles is not required for the reconstitution of select intracellular traffic steps has revolutionized cell biology. It transformed the discipline from a morphological one into a molecular one. It helped in defining the activities of COPII and COPI vesicle coats in secretion. The work established the principles of the vesicular traffic model as envisioned by George Palade 50 years ago. However, in recent years, numerous advances in cellular and imaging technologies afforded an unprecedented molecular resolution that sheds new light on COPII activities and biosynthetic traffic between the ER and the Golgi. In the following review, I summarize this new information and attempt to provide a unified physical-molecular-morphological description of this traffic step. This information expands on the simplistic principles of vesicular traffic and provides novel frameworks to examine and explain physiological secretion.},

Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy offers the required spatial resolution but struggles to reveal more than four different targets simultaneously. Exchanging labels in subsequent imaging rounds for multiplexed imaging extends this number but is limited by its low throughput. Here we present a novel imaging method for rapid multiplexed super-resolution microscopy of a nearly unlimited number of molecular targets by leveraging fluorogenic labeling in conjunction with Transient Adapter-mediated switching for high-throughput DNA-PAINT (FLASH-PAINT). We demonstrate the cell biological versatility of FLASH-PAINT in mammalian cells in four applications: i) mapping nine proteins in a single mammalian cell, ii) elucidating the functional organization of primary cilia by nine-target imaging, iii) revealing the changes in proximity of twelve different targets in unperturbed and dissociated Golgi stacks and iv) investigating inter-organelle contacts at 3D super-resolution.},

abstract ={It is well-known that aqueous dispersions of phospholipids spontaneously assemble into bilayer structures. These structures have numerous applications across chemistry and materials science and form the fundamental structural unit of the biological membrane. The particular environment of the lipid bilayer, with a water-poor low dielectric core surrounded by a more polar and better hydrated interfacial region, gives the membrane particular biophysical and physicochemical properties and presents a unique environment for chemical reactions to occur. Many different types of molecule spanning a range of sizes, from dissolved gases through small organics to proteins, are able to interact with membranes and promote chemical changes to lipids that subsequently affect the physicochemical properties of the bilayer. This Review describes the chemical reactivity exhibited by lipids in their membrane form, with an emphasis on conditions where the lipids are well hydrated in the form of bilayers. Key topics include the following: lytic reactions of glyceryl esters, including hydrolysis, aminolysis, and transesterification; oxidation reactions of alkenes in unsaturated fatty acids and sterols, including autoxidation and oxidation by singlet oxygen; reactivity of headgroups, particularly with reactive carbonyl species; and E/Z isomerization of alkenes. The consequences of reactivity for biological activity and biophysical properties are also discussed. CONTENTS},

abstract ={Proteins essential for vesicle formation by the Coat Protein I (COPI) complex are being identified, but less is known about the role of specific lipids. Brefeldin-A ADP-ribosylated substrate (BARS) functions in the fission step of COPI vesicle formation. Here, we show that BARS induces membrane curvature in cooperation with phosphatidic acid. This finding has allowed us to further delineate COPI vesicle fission into two sub-stages: 1) an earlier stage of bud-neck constriction, in which BARS and other COPI components are required, and 2) a later stage of bud-neck scission, in which phosphatidic acid generated by phospholipase D2 (PLD2) is also required. Moreover, in contrast to the disruption of the Golgi seen on perturbing the core COPI components (such as coatomer), inhibition of PLD2 causes milder disruptions, suggesting that such COPI components have additional roles in maintaining Golgi structure other than through COPI vesicle formation.},

abstract ={Mutation of C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontal temporal degeneration (FTD), which is attributed to both a gain and loss of function. C9orf72 forms a complex with SMCR8 and WDR41, which was reported to have GTPase activating protein activity toward ARF proteins, RAB8A, and RAB11A. We determined the cryo-EM structure of ARF1-GDP-BeF 3-bound to C9orf72:SMCR8:WDR41. The SMCR8 longin and C9orf72 longin domains form the binding pocket for ARF1. One face of the C9orf72 longin domain holds ARF1 in place, while the SMCR8 longin positions the catalytic finger Arg147 in the ARF1 active site. Mutations in interfacial residues of ARF1 and C9orf72 reduced or eliminated GAP activity. RAB8A GAP required ~10-fold higher concentrations of the C9orf72 complex than for ARF1. These data support a specific function for the C9orf72 complex as an ARF GAP. The structure also provides a model for the active forms of the longin domain GAPs of FLCN and NPRL2 that regulate the Rag GTPases of the mTORC1 pathway.},

year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine are the most abundant phospholipids in eukaryotic cells and thus have major roles in the formation and maintenance of vesicular membranes. In yeast, diacylglycerol accepts a phosphocholine moiety through a CPT1-derived cholinephosphotransferase activity to directly synthesize phosphatidylcholine. EPT1-derived activity can transfer either phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine to diacylglcyerol in vitro, but is currently believed to primarily synthesize phosphatidylethanolamine in vivo. In this study we report that CPT1-and EPT1-derived cholinephosphotransferase activities can significantly overlap in vivo such that EPT1 can contribute to 60% of net phosphatidylcholine synthesis via the Kennedy pathway. Alterations in the level of diacylglycerol consumption through alterations in phosphatidylcholine synthesis directly correlated with the level of SEC14-dependent invertase secretion and affected cell viability. Administration of synthetic di8:0 diacylglycerol resulted in a partial rescue of cells from SEC14-mediated cell death. The addition of di8:0 diacylglycerol increased di8:0 diacylglycerol levels 20-40-fold over endogenous long-chain diacylglycerol levels. Di8:0 diacylglcyerol did not alter endogenous phospholipid metabolic pathways, nor was it converted to di8:0 phosphatidic acid.},

abstract ={The mammalian Golgi comprises tightly adjacent and flattened membrane sacs called cisternae. We still do not understand the molecular organization of the Golgi and intra-Golgi transport of cargos. One of the most significant challenges to studying the Golgi is resolving Golgi proteins at the cisternal level under light microscopy. We have developed a side-averaging approach to visualize the cisternal organization and intra-Golgi transport in nocodazole-induced Golgi ministacks. Side-view images of ministacks acquired from Airyscan microscopy are transformed and aligned before intensity normalization and averaging. From side-average images of >30 Golgi proteins, we uncovered the organization of the pre-Golgi, cis, medial, trans, and trans-Golgi network membrane with an unprecedented spatial resolution. We observed the progressive transition of a synchronized cargo wave from the cis to the trans-side of the Golgi. Our data support our previous finding, in which constitutive cargos exit at the trans-Golgi while the secretory targeting to the trans-Golgi network is signal dependent. .},

doi ={10.1038/s41467-022-30060-w},
abstract ={Statins are a class of drug widely prescribed for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, with pleiotropic cellular effects. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), which converts the metabolite HMG-CoA into mevalonate. Recent discoveries have shown HMG-CoA is a reactive metabolite that can non-enzymatically modify proteins and impact their activity. Therefore, we predicted that inhibition of HMGCR by statins might increase HMG-CoA levels and protein modifications. Upon statin treatment, we observe a strong increase in HMG-CoA levels and modification of only a single protein. Mass spectrometry identifies this protein as fatty acid synthase (FAS), which is modified on active site residues and, importantly, on nonlysine side-chains. The dynamic modifications occur only on a sub-pool of FAS that is located near HMGCR and alters cellular signaling around the ER and Golgi. These results uncover communication between cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis by the substrate of one pathway inhibiting another in a rapid and reversible manner.},

abstract ={Basic structure studies of the biosynthetic machinery of the cell by electron microscopy (EM) have underpinned much of our fundamental knowledge in the areas of molecular cell biology and membrane traffic. Driven by our collective desire to understand how changes in the complex and dynamic structure of this enigmatic organelle relate to its pivotal roles in the cell, the comparatively high-resolution glimpses of the Golgi and other compartments of the secretory pathway offered to us through EM have helped to inspire the development and application of some of our most informative, complimentary (molecular, biochemical and genetic) approaches. Even so, no one has yet even come close to relating the basic molecular mechanisms of transport, through and from the Golgi, to its ultrastructure, to everybody's satisfaction. Over the past decade, EM tomography has afforded new insights into structure-function relationships of the Golgi and provoked a re-evaluation of older paradigms. By providing a set of tools for structurally dissecting cells at high-resolution in three-dimensions (3D), EM tomography has emerged as a method for studying molecular cell biology in situ. As we move rapidly toward the establishment of molecular atlases of organelles through advances in proteomics and genomics, tomographic studies of the Golgi offer the tantalizing possibility that one day, we will be able to map the spatio-temporal coordinates of Golgi-related proteins and lipids accurately in the context of 4D cellular space.},

title ={Preferential electrostatic interactions of phosphatidic acid with arginines},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.1039/d4sm00088a},
abstract ={Phosphatidic acid (PA) is an anionic lipid that preferentially interacts with proteins in a diverse set of cellular processes such as transport, apoptosis, and neurotransmission. One such interaction is that of the PA lipids with the proteins of voltage-sensitive ion channels. In comparison to several other similarly charged anionic lipids, PA lipids exhibit much stronger interactions. Intrigued and motivated by this finding, we sought out to gain deeper understanding into the electrostatic interactions of anionic lipids with charged proteins. Using the voltage sensor domain (VSD) of the KvAP channel as a model system, we performed long-timescale atomistic simulations to analyze the interactions of POPA, POPG, and POPI lipids with arginines (ARGs). Our simulations reveal two mechanisms. First, POPA is able to interact not only with surface ARGs but is able to snorkel and interact with a buried arginine. POPG and POPI lipids on the other hand show weak interactions even with both the surface and buried ARGs. Second, deprotonated POPA with À2 charge is able to break the salt-bridge connection between VSD protein segments and establish its own electrostatic bond with the ARG. Based on these findings, we propose a headgroup size hypothesis for preferential solvation of proteins by charged lipids. These findings may be valuable in understanding how PA lipids could be modulating kinematics of transmembrane proteins in cellular membranes.},

doi ={10.1101/2024.05.01.592120},
abstract ={Live cell imaging of lipids and other metabolites is a long-standing challenge in cell biology. Bioorthogonal labeling tools allow for the conjugation of fluorophores to several phospholipid classes, but cannot discern their trafficking between adjacent organelles or asymmetry across individual membrane leaflets. Here we present fluorogen-activating coincidence sensing (FACES), a chemogenetic tool capable of quantitatively imaging subcellular lipid pools and reporting their transbilayer orientation in living cells. FACES combines bioorthogonal chemistry with genetically encoded fluorogen-activating proteins (FAPs) for reversible proximity sensing of conjugated molecules. We first validate this approach for quantifying discrete phosphatidylcholine pools in the ER and mitochondria that are trafficked by lipid transfer proteins. We then show that transmembrane domain-containing FAPs can be used to reveal the membrane asymmetry of multiple lipid classes that are generated in the trans-Golgi network. Lastly, we demonstrate that FACES is a generalizable tool for subcellular bioorthogonal imaging by measuring changes in mitochondrial N-acetylhexosamine levels. These results demonstrate the use of fluorogenic tags for spatially-defined molecular imaging.},

doi ={10.1242/jcs.217992},
abstract ={Metabolic disorders, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), are emerging as epidemics that affect the global population. One facet of these disorders is attributed to the disturbance of membrane lipid composition. Perturbation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis through alteration in membrane phospholipids activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) and causes dramatic transcriptional and translational changes in the cell. To restore cellular homeostasis, the three highly conserved UPR transducers ATF6, IRE1 (also known as ERN1 in mammals) and PERK (also known as EIF2AK3 in mammals) mediate adaptive responses upon ER stress. The homeostatic UPR cascade is well characterised under conditions of proteotoxic stress, but much less so under lipid bilayer stress-induced UPR. Here, we show that disrupted phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis in Caenorhabditis elegans causes lipid bilayer stress, lipid droplet accumulation and ER stress induction. Transcriptional profiling of PC-deficient worms revealed a unique subset of genes regulated in a UPR-dependent manner that is independent from proteotoxic stress. Among these, we show that autophagy is modulated through the conserved IRE-1-XBP-1 axis, strongly suggesting of the importance of autophagy in maintaining cellular homeostasis during the lipid bilayer stress-induced UPR.},

title ={Non-disruptive inducible labeling of ER-membrane contact sites using the Lamin B Receptor},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.1101/2024.05.31.596797},
abstract ={Membrane contact sites (MCSs) are areas of close proximity between organelles that allow the exchange of material, among other roles. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has MCSs with a variety of organelles in the cell. MCSs are dynamic, responding to changes in cell state, and are therefore best visualized through inducible labeling methods. However, existing methods typically distort ER-MCSs, by expanding contacts or creating artificial ones. Here we describe a new method for inducible labeling of ER-MCSs using the Lamin B receptor (LBR) and a generic anchor protein on the partner organelle. Termed LaBeRling, this versatile, one-to-many approach allows labeling of different types of ER-MCSs (mitochondria, plasma membrane, lysosomes, early endosomes, lipid droplets and Golgi), on-demand, in interphase or mitotic cells. LaBeRling is non-disruptive and does not change ER-MCSs in terms of the contact number, extent or distance measured; as determined by light microscopy or a deep-learning volume electron microscopy approach. We applied this method to study the changes in ER-MCSs during mitosis and to label novel ER-Golgi contact sites at different mitotic stages in live cells. membrane contact sites | ER-Golgi contacts | inducible labeling},

doi ={10.1371/journal.pbio.3001431},
abstract ={To survive elevated temperatures, ectotherms adjust the fluidity of membranes by fine-tuning lipid desaturation levels in a process previously described to be cell autonomous. We have discovered that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, neuronal heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), the conserved master regulator of the heat shock response (HSR), causes extensive fat remodeling in peripheral tissues. These changes include a decrease in fat desaturase and acid lipase expression in the intestine and a global shift in the saturation levels of plasma membrane's phospholipids. The observed remodeling of plasma membrane is in line with ectothermic adaptive responses and gives worms a cumulative advantage to warm temperatures. We have determined that at least 6 TAX-2/TAX-4 cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) gated channel expressing sensory neurons, and transforming growth factor ß (TGF-β)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) are required for signaling across tissues to modulate fat desaturation. We also find neuronal hsf-1 is not only sufficient but also partially necessary to control the fat remodeling response and for survival at warm temperatures. This is the first study to show that a thermostat-based mechanism can cell nonautonomously coordinate membrane saturation and composition across tissues in a multicellular animal.},

doi ={10.1101/2024.05.27.596058},
abstract ={Lipid transfer through membrane contact has been implicated to support vesicular transport, but a mechanistic understanding of this process remains to be achieved. Here, examining Coat Protein I (COPI) transport, we find that phosphatidylcholine (PC) with short acyl chains (sPC), which is needed to support COPI vesicle fission, is delivered through membrane contact from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex at sites of COPI vesicle formation. Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein beta (PITP) plays a central role in this delivery by not only catalyzing PC transfer, but also forming membrane contact. By combining cell-based studies with reconstitution approaches, we achieve spatial and temporal detail in explaining how sPC delivery occurs. Our findings advance the mechanistic understanding of how membrane contact is needed for vesicular transport in a model pathway and shed new insights into how PITP acts.},

Instead, it is proposed that Golgi apparatus proteins continuously recycle via the endoplasmic reticulum by vesicle transport, whereas cargo molecules remain in maturing cisternal structures. Rather than forming a rigid matrix, structural Golgi proteins might be highly dynamic and recycle via the cytoplasm. I will discuss the evidence for these claims and consider whether or not they really disprove older ideas on how the Golgi apparatus is structured and performs its function.},

abstract ={The vast majority of proteins that a cell secretes or displays on its surface first enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they fold and assemble. Only properly assembled proteins advance from the ER to the cell surface. To ascertain fidelity in protein folding, cells regulate the protein-folding capacity in the ER according to need. The ER responds to the burden of unfolded proteins in its lumen (ER stress) by activating intracellular signal transduction pathways, collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). Together, at least three mechanistically distinct branches of the UPR regulate the expression of numerous genes that maintain homeostasis in the ER or induce apoptosis if ER stress remains unmitigated. Recent advances shed light on mechanistic complexities and on the role of the UPR in numerous diseases.},

abstract ={The Golgi apparatus regulates the process of modification and subcellular localization of macromolecules, including proteins and lipids. Aberrant protein sorting caused by defects in the Golgi leads to various diseases in mammals. However, the role of the Golgi apparatus in organismal longevity remained largely unknown. By employing a quantitative proteomic approach, we demonstrated that MON-2, an evolutionarily conserved Arf-GEF protein implicated in Golgi-to-endosome trafficking, promotes longevity via upregulating macroautophagy/ autophagy in C. elegans. Our data using cultured mammalian cells indicate that MON2 translocates from the Golgi to the endosome under starvation conditions, subsequently increasing autophagic flux by binding LGG-1/GABARAPL2. Thus, Golgi-to-endosome trafficking appears to be an evolutionarily conserved process for the upregulation of autophagy, which contributes to organismal longevity.},

abstract ={Aims/hypothesis The minor A allele of rs373863828 (CREBRF p.Arg457Gln) is associated with increased BMI, but reduced risk of type 2 and gestational diabetes in Polynesian (Pacific peoples and Aotearoa New Zealand Māori) populations. This study investigates the effect of the A allele on insulin release and sensitivity in overweight/obese men without diabetes. Methods A mixed meal tolerance test was completed by 172 men (56 with the A allele) of Māori or Pacific ancestry, and 44 (24 with the A allele) had a frequently sampled IVGTT and hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. Mixed linear models with covariates age, ancestry and BMI were used to analyse the association between the A allele of rs373863828 and markers of insulin release and blood glucose regulation. Results The A allele of rs373863828 is associated with a greater increase in plasma insulin 30 min following a meal challenge without affecting the elevation in plasma glucose or incretins glucagon-like polypeptide-1 or gastric inhibitory polypeptide. Consistent with this point, following an i.v. infusion of a glucose bolus, participants with an A allele had higher early (p < 0.05 at 2 and 4 min) plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations for a similar elevation in blood glucose as those homozygous for the major (G) allele. Despite increased plasma insulin, rs373863828 genotype was not associated with a significant difference (p > 0.05) in insulin sensitivity index or glucose disposal during hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. Conclusions/interpretation rs373863828-A allele associates with increased glucose-stimulated insulin release without affecting insulin sensitivity, suggesting that CREBRF p.Arg457Gln may increase insulin release to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.},

year ={2017},
doi ={10.1242/jcs.211102},
abstract ={Many secretory cells increase the synthesis and secretion of cargo proteins in response to specific stimuli. How cells couple increased cargo load with a coordinate rise in secretory capacity to ensure efficient transport is not well understood. We used thyroid cells stimulated with thyrotropin (TSH) to demonstrate a coordinate increase in the production of thyroid-specific cargo proteins and ER-Golgi transport factors, and a parallel expansion of the Golgi complex. TSH also increased expression of the CREB3L1 transcription factor, which alone caused amplified transport factor levels and Golgi enlargement. Furthermore, CREB3L1 potentiated the TSH-induced increase in Golgi volume. A dominant-negative CREB3L1 construct hampered the ability of TSH to induce Golgi expansion, implying that this transcription factor contributes to Golgi expansion. Our findings support a model in which CREB3L1 acts as a downstream effector of TSH to regulate the expression of cargo proteins, and simultaneously increases the synthesis of transport factors and the expansion of the Golgi to synchronize the rise in cargo load with the amplified capacity of the secretory pathway.},

abstract ={Biological membranes are key elements for the maintenance of cell architecture and physiology. Beyond a pure barrier separating the inner space of the cell from the outer, the plasma membrane is a scaffold and player in cell-to-cell communication and the initiation of intracellular signals among other functions. Critical to this function is the plasma membrane compartmentalization in lipid microdomains that control the localization and productive interactions of proteins involved in cell signal propagation. In addition, cells are divided into compartments limited by other membranes whose integrity and homeostasis are finely controlled, and which determine the identity and function of the different organelles. Here, we review current knowledge on membrane lipid composition in the plasma membrane and endomembrane compartments, emphasizing its role in sustaining organelle structure and function. The correct composition and structure of cell membranes define key pathophysiological aspects of cells. Therefore, we explore the therapeutic potential of manipulating membrane lipid composition with approaches like membrane lipid therapy, aiming to normalize cell functions through the modification of membrane lipid bilayers.},

abstract ={Lipid mobilization through fatty acid β-oxidation is a central process essential for energy production during nutrient shortage. In yeast, this catabolic process starts in the peroxisome from where β-oxidation products enter mitochondria and fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Little is known about the physical and metabolic cooperation between these organelles. Here we found that expression of fatty acid transporters and of the rate-limiting enzyme involved in β-oxidation is decreased in cells expressing a hyperactive mutant of the small GTPase Arf1, leading to an accumulation of fatty acids in lipid droplets. Consequently, mitochondria became fragmented and ATP synthesis decreased. Genetic and pharmacological depletion of fatty acids phenocopied the arf1 mutant mitochondrial phenotype. Although β-oxidation occurs in both mitochondria and peroxisomes in mammals, Arf1's role in fatty acid metabolism is conserved. Together, our results indicate that Arf1 integrates metabolism into energy production by regulating fatty acid storage and utilization, and presumably organelle contact sites.},

year ={2010},
doi ={10.1210/en.2010-0137},
abstract ={Old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS) has previously been shown to be a putative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor in astrocytes with a mechanism of activation that is similar to ATF6. In this study we investigated the expression and activation of endogenous and overexpressed OASIS in pancreatic ␤-cells. OASIS mRNA expression was detected in pancreatic ␤-cell lines and rodent islets, and the expression level was up-regulated by ER stress-inducing compounds. Endogenous OASIS protein, however, is expressed at low levels in pancreatic ␤-cell lines and rodent islets, possibly due to abundant levels of the micro-RNA miR-140 present in these cells. In contrast, expression of both full-length and cleaved (active) OASIS was readily detectable in the developing mouse pancreas (embryonic d 15.5). Microarray analysis after expression of an active nuclearlocalized version of OASIS in an inducible INS-1 ␤-cell line resulted in the up-regulation of many genes implicated in extracellular matrix production and protein transport but not classical ER stress response genes. Consistent with this, expression of active OASIS failed to induce glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa promoter activity in pancreatic ␤-cells. These results suggest that the repertoire of genes induced by OASIS is cell type-dependent and that the OASIS protein may have a role in pancreas development. (Endocrinology 151: 4146-4157, 2010},

title ={Drug-induced phospholipidosis confounds drug repurposing for SARS-CoV-2},
year ={2024},
doi ={},
abstract ={Repurposing drugs as treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has drawn much attention. Beginning with sigma receptor ligands and expanding to other drugs from screening in the field, we became concerned that phospholipidosis was a shared mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of many repurposed drugs. For all of the 23 cationic amphiphilic drugs we tested, including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, amiodarone, and four others already in clinical trials, phospholipidosis was monotonically correlated with antiviral efficacy. Conversely, drugs active against the same targets that did not induce phospholipidosis were not antiviral. Phospholipidosis depends on the physicochemical properties of drugs and does not reflect specific targetbased activities-rather, it may be considered a toxic confound in early drug discovery. Early detection of phospholipidosis could eliminate these artifacts, enabling a focus on molecules with therapeutic potential.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1101/2021.11.16.468906},
abstract ={The redox reagent dithiothreitol (DTT) causes stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by disrupting its oxidative protein folding environment, which results in the accumulation and misfolding of the newly synthesized proteins. DTT may potentially impact cellular physiology by ER-independent mechanisms; however, such mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Using the nematode model Caenorhabditis elegans, here we show that DTT toxicity is modulated by the bacterial diet. Specifically, the dietary component vitamin B12 alleviates DTT toxicity in a methionine synthase-dependent manner. Using a forward genetic screen, we identify that loss-of-function of R08E5.3, an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)dependent methyltransferase, imparts resistance to DTT. DTT upregulates R08E5.3 expression and modulates the activity of the methionine-homocysteine cycle. Employing genetic studies, we show that DTT toxicity is a result of the depletion of SAM. Finally, we show that a functional IRE-1/XBP-1 unfolded protein response pathway is required to counteract toxicity at high, but not low, DTT concentrations.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-021-27279-4},
abstract ={AGPATs (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferases) catalyze the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid to form phosphatidic acid (PA), a key step in the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway for the synthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerols. AGPAT2 is the only AGPAT isoform whose loss-of-function mutations cause a severe form of human congenital generalized lipodystrophy. Paradoxically, AGPAT2 deficiency is known to dramatically increase the level of its product, PA. Here, we find that AGPAT2 deficiency impairs the biogenesis and growth of lipid droplets. We show that AGPAT2 deficiency compromises the stability of CDPdiacylglycerol (DAG) synthases (CDSs) and decreases CDS activity in both cell lines and mouse liver. Moreover, AGPAT2 and CDS1/2 can directly interact and form functional complexes, which promote the metabolism of PA along the CDP-DAG pathway of phospholipid synthesis. Our results provide key insights into the regulation of metabolic flux during lipid synthesis and suggest substrate channelling at a major branch point of the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway.},

title ={Cell-surface glycans are quantitative reporters of Golgi dysfunction in single cells},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.1101/2024.06.17.599374},
abstract ={Complex sugar polymers known as glycans contribute to the high molecular diversity of the eukaryotic cell surface. The types and levels of glycans on one cell can be sensed by other cells using carbohydrate-specific binding proteins such as lectins, enabling glycans to regulate cell-cell interactions. Glycans are covalently assembled onto proteins and lipids as they traverse the secretory pathway, a tightly regulated process known as glycosylation and carried out by Golgi-resident enzymes. Errors in glycosylation due to the dysfunctional trafficking of enzymes and substrates in the Golgi are implicated in human diseases. Here we ask how much information about Golgi dysfunction is encoded by surface glycans in single cells. This task is challenging due to high cell-to-cell variability in glycan levels. We exploited the loss-of-adhesion driven disorganization of the Golgi in mouse fibroblasts to generate a highly reproducible gradient of Golgi morphology phenotypes, by titrating the Arf1 inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA). We measured the resulting distribution of cell-surface glycans in single cells using two fluorescently tagged lectin probes (ConA and WGA). A mathematical model of intracellular traffic, parameterized against measurements of Golgi fragmentation and endocytosis, quantitatively explains cell-surface lectin levels across time and BFA concentrations. We used this model to construct an optimal Bayesian decoder and showed that singlecell lectin measurements predict Golgi phenotypes with accuracy far greater than chance. By combining signals from two lectins we further improved prediction accuracy and speed. Such multilectin information may be exploited during natural cell-cell communication, and in the development of single-cell diagnostics.},

year ={2018},
doi ={10.1038/s41598-018-35190-0},
abstract ={The spatial organization of cells depends on coordination between cytoskeletal systems and intracellular organelles. The Arf1 small G protein and its activator GBF1 are important regulators of Golgi organization, maintaining its morphology and function. Here we show that GBF1 and its substrate Arf1 regulate the spatial organization of mitochondria in a microtubule-dependent manner. Miro is a mitochondrial membrane protein that interacts through adaptors with microtubule motor proteins such as cytoplasmic dynein, the major microtubule minus end directed motor. We demonstrate a physical interaction between GBF1 and Miro, and also between the active GTP-bound form of Arf1 and Miro. Inhibition of GBF1, inhibition of Arf1 activation, or overexpression of Miro, caused a collapse of the mitochondrial network towards the centrosome. The change in mitochondrial morphology upon GBF1 inhibition was due to a twofold increase in the time engaged in retrograde movement compared to control conditions. Electron tomography revealed that GBF1 inhibition also resulted in larger mitochondria with more complex morphology. Miro silencing or drug inhibition of cytoplasmic dynein activity blocked the GBF1-dependent repositioning of mitochondria. Our results show that blocking GBF1 function promotes dynein-and Miro-dependent retrograde mitochondrial transport along microtubules towards the microtubule-organizing center, where they form an interconnected network.},

title ={Genes in human obesity loci are causal obesity genes in C. elegans},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1009736},
abstract ={Obesity and its associated metabolic syndrome are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Given the disease's heavy burden on patients and the healthcare system, there has been increased interest in identifying pharmacological targets for the treatment and prevention of obesity. Towards this end, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of human genetic variants associated with obesity. The next challenge is to experimentally define which of these variants are causally linked to obesity, and could therefore become targets for the treatment or prevention of obesity. Here we employ highthroughput in vivo RNAi screening to test for causality 293 C. elegans orthologs of human obesity-candidate genes reported in GWAS. We RNAi screened these 293 genes in C. elegans subject to two different feeding regimens: (1) regular diet, and (2) high-fructose diet, which we developed and present here as an invertebrate model of diet-induced obesity (DIO). We report 14 genes that promote obesity and 3 genes that prevent DIO when silenced in C. elegans. Further, we show that knock-down of the 3 DIO genes not only prevents excessive fat accumulation in primary and ectopic fat depots but also improves the health and extends the lifespan of C. elegans overconsuming fructose. Importantly, the direction of the association between expression variants in these loci and obesity in mice and humans matches the phenotypic outcome of the loss-of-function of the C. elegans ortholog genes, supporting the notion that some of these genes would be causally linked to obesity across phylogeny. Therefore, in addition to defining causality for several genes so far merely correlated with obesity, this study demonstrates the value of model systems compatible with in vivo high-throughput genetic screening to causally link GWAS gene candidates to human diseases.},

title ={An antisteatosis response regulated by oleic acid through lipid droplet-mediated ERAD enhancement},
year ={2024},
doi ={},
abstract ={Although excessive lipid accumulation is a hallmark of obesity-related pathologies, some lipids are beneficial. Oleic acid (OA), the most abundant monounsaturated fatty acid (FA), promotes health and longevity. Here, we show that OA benefits Caenorhabditis elegans by activating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transcription factor SKN-1A (Nrf1/NFE2L1) in a lipid homeostasis response. SKN-1A/Nrf1 is cleared from the ER by the ERassociated degradation (ERAD) machinery and stabilized when proteasome activity is low and canonically maintains proteasome homeostasis. Unexpectedly, OA increases nuclear SKN-1A levels independently of proteasome activity, through lipid droplet-dependent enhancement of ERAD. In turn, SKN-1A reduces steatosis by reshaping the lipid metabolism transcriptome and mediates longevity from OA provided through endogenous accumulation, reduced H3K4 trimethylation, or dietary supplementation. Our findings reveal an unexpected mechanism of FA signal transduction, as well as a lipid homeostasis pathway that provides strategies for opposing steatosis and aging, and may mediate some benefits of the OA-rich Mediterranean diet.},

year ={2008},
doi ={10.1021/bi702468g},
abstract ={The genome of Caenorhabditis elegans encodes for 18 putative nucleotide sugar transporters even though its glycome only contains 7 different monosaccharides. To understand the biological significance of this phenomenon, we have begun a systematic substrate characterization of the above putative transporters and have determined that the gene ZK896.9 encodes a Golgi apparatus transporter for UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine. This is the first tetrasubstrate nucleotide sugar transporter characterized for any organism and is also the first nonplant transporter for UDP-glucose. Evidence for the above substrate specificity and substrate transport saturation kinetics was obtained by expression of ZK896.9 in Saccharomyces cereVisiae followed by Golgi enriched vesicle isolation and assays in Vitro. Further evidence for UDP-glucose transport was obtained by expression of ZK 896.9 in Giardia lamblia, an organism recently characterized as having endogenous transport activity for only UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Expression of ZK896.9 was also able to correct the phenotype of a mutant Chinese ovary cell line specifically defective in the transport of UDP-galactose into the Golgi apparatus and of a mutant of the yeast KluyVeromyces lactis specifically defective in the transport of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine into its Golgi apparatus. Because up to now all three other characterized nucleotide sugar transporters of C. elegans have been found to transport two or three substrates, the substrate specificity of ZK896.9 raises questions as to the evolutionary ancestry of this group of proteins in this nematode.},

doi ={10.1021/acscentsci.3c01105},
abstract ={Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a multifunctional lipid with important metabolic and signaling functions, and efforts to dissect its pleiotropy demand strategies for perturbing its levels with spatiotemporal precision. Previous membrane editing approaches for generating local PA pools used light-mediated induced proximity to recruit a PA-synthesizing enzyme, phospholipase D (PLD), from the cytosol to the target organelle membrane. Whereas these optogenetic PLDs exhibited high activity, their residual activity in the dark led to undesired chronic lipid production. Here, we report ultralow background membrane editors for PA wherein light directly controls PLD catalytic activity, as opposed to localization and access to substrates, exploiting a light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain-based conformational photoswitch inserted into the PLD sequence and enabling their stable and nonperturbative targeting to multiple organelle membranes. By coupling organelle-targeted LOVPLD activation to lipidomics analysis, we discovered different rates of metabolism for PA and its downstream products depending on the subcellular location of PA production. We also elucidated signaling roles for PA pools on different membranes in conferring local activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling. This work illustrates how membrane editors featuring acute, optogenetic conformational switches can provide new insights into organelle-selective lipid metabolic and signaling pathways.},

title ={Membrane Architecture in the Spotlight of Correlative Microscopy},

doi ={10.1016/j.tcb.2020.04.003},
abstract ={Cellular membranes differ in their molecular organisation, shape, and dynamics. Knowing how these properties of membrane architecture relate to the presence and function of specific membrane components is fundamental for understanding membrane-associated cellular processes. Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) is ideally poised to address such problems. Fluorescence microscopy allows identification of cellular membranes through labelled components and can provide temporal information, while electron microscopy allows visualisation of the structure of the same membranes at high resolution. In recent years, various CLEM protocols have been applied to gain insights into cellular membrane architecture. Here, we review conceptually novel approaches by which CLEM has provided insights on membrane reshaping, subcellular localisation of components, host-pathogen interactions, and has answered longstanding mechanistic questions. Membrane Architecture: Organisation at Multiple Levels and Resolution Scales Highlights New CLEM approaches allow addressing diverse questions on cellular membrane architecture. CLEM can add temporal and compositional information to membrane shape and topology, and can facilitate identification of rare structures or events. The large diversity of CLEM protocols permits precisely tailoring the experimental setup to specific biological questions. The conceptual advances enabled by CLEM emphasise the importance of architecture for membrane-associated cellular functions.},

title ={Preferential electrostatic interactions of phosphatidic acid with arginines},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.1039/d4sm00088a},
abstract ={Phosphatidic acid (PA) is an anionic lipid that preferentially interacts with proteins in a diverse set of cellular processes such as transport, apoptosis, and neurotransmission. One such interaction is that of the PA lipids with the proteins of voltage-sensitive ion channels. In comparison to several other similarly charged anionic lipids, PA lipids exhibit much stronger interactions. Intrigued and motivated by this finding, we sought out to gain deeper understanding into the electrostatic interactions of anionic lipids with charged proteins. Using the voltage sensor domain (VSD) of the KvAP channel as a model system, we performed long-timescale atomistic simulations to analyze the interactions of POPA, POPG, and POPI lipids with arginines (ARGs). Our simulations reveal two mechanisms. First, POPA is able to interact not only with surface ARGs but is able to snorkel and interact with a buried arginine. POPG and POPI lipids on the other hand show weak interactions even with both the surface and buried ARGs. Second, deprotonated POPA with À2 charge is able to break the salt-bridge connection between VSD protein segments and establish its own electrostatic bond with the ARG. Based on these findings, we propose a headgroup size hypothesis for preferential solvation of proteins by charged lipids. These findings may be valuable in understanding how PA lipids could be modulating kinematics of transmembrane proteins in cellular membranes.},

year ={2012},
doi ={10.1016/j.lfs.2012.11.001},
abstract ={Aims: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress modulates gene expression and has been implicated in causing dyslipidemias. To determine if ER stress may contribute to hypoalphalipoproteinemia through suppression of apo A-I gene expression, human hepatoma cell line Hep G2 was treated with ER stress inducers and the changes in apo A-I gene expression were compared to albumin gene expression. Main methods: HepG2 cells were treated with tunicamycin (TM) and thapsigargin (TG), two potent inducers of ER stress, and apo A-I and albumin protein levels, mRNA levels, and promoter activity were measured. ER stress was measured using the ER stress-responsive alkaline phosphatase assay and by Western blot quantitation of ER stress markers such as glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP-78), phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinase (phospho-JNK), total JNK, phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (phospho eIF2α), and total eIF2α. Key findings: TM and TG induced ER stress in HepG2 cells and reduced apo A-I and albumin secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Intracellular albumin levels increased in cells treated with TM and TG while intracellular apo A-I levels decreased. Albumin mRNA and albumin gene promoter activity were reduced in proportion to the decrease in albumin secreted while changes in the apo A-I mRNA levels and promoter activity were modest and did not account for the reduction in apo A-I secretion. Significance: These results indicate that apo A-I secretion is inhibited by ER stress possibly by affecting cellular degradation pathways. However, ER stress does not affect apo A-I secretion by regulating gene expression.},

abstract ={In order to better understand the process of breast cancer metastasis, we have generated a mammary epithelial progression series of increasingly aggressive cell lines that metastasize to lung. Here, we demonstrate that up-regulation of an Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) to Golgi trafficking gene signature in metastatic cells enhances transport kinetics, which promotes malignant progression. We observe increased ER-Golgi trafficking, an altered secretome and sensitivity to the retrograde transport inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) in cells that metastasize to lung. CREB3 was identified as a transcriptional regulator of up-regulated ER-Golgi trafficking genes ARF4, COPB1 and USO1, and silencing of these genes attenuated the metastatic phenotype in vitro and lung colonization in vivo. Furthermore, high trafficking gene expression significantly correlated with increased risk of distant metastasis and reduced relapse-free and overall survival in breast cancer patients, suggesting that modulation of ER-Golgi trafficking plays an important role in metastatic progression.},

abstract ={In mammalian cells, >25% of synthesized proteins are exported through the secretory pathway. The pathway complexity, however, obfuscates its impact on the secretion of different proteins. Unraveling its impact on diverse proteins is particularly important for biopharmaceutical production. Here we delineate the core secretory pathway functions and integrate them with genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of human, mouse, and Chinese hamster ovary cells. The resulting reconstructions enable the computation of energetic costs and machinery demands of each secreted protein. By integrating additional omics data, we find that highly secretory cells have adapted to reduce expression and secretion of other expensive host cell proteins. Furthermore, we predict metabolic costs and maximum productivities of biotherapeutic proteins and identify protein features that most significantly impact protein secretion. Finally, the model successfully predicts the increase in secretion of a monoclonal antibody after silencing a highly expressed selection marker. This work represents a knowledgebase of the mammalian secretory pathway that serves as a novel tool for systems biotechnology.},

title ={ER Unfolded Protein Response in Liver In Vivo Is Characterized by Reduced, Not Increased, De Novo Lipogenesis and Cholesterol Synthesis Rates with Uptake of Fatty Acids from Adipose Tissue: Integrated Gene Expression, Translation Rates and Metabolic Fluxes},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.3390/ijms23031073},
abstract ={The unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum (UPR ER) is involved in a number of metabolic diseases. Here, we characterize UPR ER-induced metabolic changes in mouse livers in vivo through metabolic labeling and mass spectrometric analysis of lipid and proteome-wide fluxes. We induced UPR ER by tunicamycin administration and measured synthesis rates of proteins, fatty acids and cholesterol, as well as RNA-seq. Contrary to reports in isolated cells, hepatic de novo lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis were markedly reduced, as were mRNA levels and synthesis rates of lipogenic proteins. H&E staining showed enrichment with lipid droplets while electron microscopy revealed ER morphological changes. Interestingly, the pre-labeling of adipose tissue prior to UPR ER induction resulted in the redistribution of labeled fatty acids from adipose tissue to the liver, with replacement by unlabeled glycerol in the liver acylglycerides, indicating that the liver uptake was of free fatty acids, not whole glycerolipids. The redistribution of adipose fatty acids to the liver was not explicable by altered plasma insulin, increased fatty acid levels (lipolysis) or by reduced food intake. Synthesis of most liver proteins was suppressed under UPR ER conditions, with the exception of BiP, other chaperones, protein disulfide isomerases, and proteins of ribosomal biogenesis. Protein synthesis rates generally, but not always, paralleled changes in mRNA. In summary, this combined approach, linking static changes with fluxes, revealed an integrated reduction of lipid and cholesterol synthesis pathways, from gene expression to translation and metabolic flux rates, under UPR ER conditions. The reduced lipogenesis does not parallel human fatty liver disease. This approach provides powerful tools to characterize metabolic processes underlying hepatic UPR ER in vivo.},

title ={Tissue-specific autophagy responses to aging and stress in C. elegans},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={Cellular function relies on a balance between protein synthesis and breakdown. Macromolecular breakdown through autophagy is broadly required for cellular and tissue development, function, and recovery from stress. While Caenorhabditis elegans is frequently used to explore cellular responses to development and stress, the most common assays for autophagy in this system lack tissue-level resolution. Different tissues within an organism have unique functional characteristics and likely vary in their reliance on autophagy under different conditions. To generate a tissuespecific map of autophagy in C. elegans we used a dual fluorescent protein (dFP) tag that releases monomeric fluorescent protein (mFP) upon arrival at the lysosome. Tissue-specific expression of dFP::LGG-1 revealed autophagic flux in all tissues, but mFP accumulation was most dramatic in the intestine. We also observed variable responses to stress: starvation increased autophagic mFP release in all tissues, whereas anoxia primarily increased intestinal autophagic flux. We observed autophagic flux with tagged LGG-1, LGG-2, and two autophagic cargo reporters: a soluble cytoplasmic protein, and mitochondrial TOMM-7. Finally, an increase in mFP in older worms was consistent with an age-dependent shift in proteostasis. These novel measures of autophagic flux in C. elegans reveal heterogeneity in autophagic response across tissues during stress and aging.},

doi ={10.7554/eLife.55745},
abstract ={Lysosomes play important roles in cellular degradation to maintain cell homeostasis. In order to understand whether and how lysosomes alter with age and contribute to lifespan regulation, we characterized multiple properties of lysosomes during the aging process in C. elegans. We uncovered age-dependent alterations in lysosomal morphology, motility, acidity and degradation activity, all of which indicate a decline in lysosome function with age. The ageassociated lysosomal changes are suppressed in the long-lived mutants daf-2, eat-2 and isp-1, which extend lifespan by inhibiting insulin/IGF-1 signaling, reducing food intake and impairing mitochondrial function, respectively. We found that 43 lysosome genes exhibit reduced expression with age, including genes encoding subunits of the proton pump V-ATPase and cathepsin proteases. The expression of lysosome genes is upregulated in the long-lived mutants, and this upregulation requires the functions of DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/NRF2 transcription factors. Impairing lysosome function affects clearance of aggregate-prone proteins and disrupts lifespan extension in daf-2, eat-2 and isp-1 worms. Our data indicate that lysosome function is modulated by multiple longevity pathways and is important for lifespan extension.},

abstract ={Cargo traffic through the Golgi apparatus is mediated by cisternal maturation, but it remains largely unclear how the cis-cisternae, the earliest Golgi sub-compartment, is generated and how the Golgi matures into the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Here, we use high-speed and highresolution confocal microscopy to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of a diverse set of proteins that reside in and around the Golgi in budding yeast. We find many mobile punctate structures that harbor yeast counterparts of mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) proteins, which we term 'yeast ERGIC'. It occasionally exhibits approach and contact behavior toward the ER exit sites and gradually matures into the cis-Golgi. Upon treatment with the Golgi-disrupting agent brefeldin A, the ERGIC proteins form larger aggregates corresponding to the Golgi entry core compartment in plants, while cis-and medial-Golgi proteins are absorbed into the ER. We further analyze the dynamics of several late Golgi proteins to better understand the Golgi-TGN transition. Together with our previous studies, we demonstrate a detailed spatiotemporal profile of the entire cisternal maturation process from the ERGIC to the Golgi and further to the TGN.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.83884},
abstract ={Changes in lipid metabolism are associated with aging and age-related diseases, including proteopathies. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is uniquely a major hub for protein and lipid synthesis, making its function essential for both protein and lipid homeostasis. However, it is less clear how lipid metabolism and protein quality may impact each other. Here, we identified let-767, a putative hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in Caenorhabditis elegans, as an essential gene for both lipid and ER protein homeostasis. Knockdown of let-767 reduces lipid stores, alters ER morphology in a lipid-dependent manner, and blocks induction of the Unfolded Protein Response of the ER (UPR ER). Interestingly, a global reduction in lipogenic pathways restores UPR ER induction in animals with reduced let-767. Specifically, we find that supplementation of 3-oxoacyl, the predicted metabolite directly upstream of let-767, is sufficient to block induction of the UPR ER. This study highlights a novel interaction through which changes in lipid metabolism can alter a cell's response to protein-induced stress.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1093/genetics/iyab093},
abstract ={The composition and biophysical properties of cellular membranes must be tightly regulated to maintain the proper functions of myriad processes within cells. To better understand the importance of membrane homeostasis, we assembled a panel of five Caenorhabditis elegans strains that show a wide span of membrane composition and properties, ranging from excessively rich in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and rigid to excessively rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and fluid. The genotypes of the five strain are, from most rigid to most fluid: paqr-1(tm3262); paqr-2(tm3410), paqr-2(tm3410), N2 (wild-type), mdt-15(et14); nhr-49(et8), and mdt-15(et14); nhr-49(et8); acs-13(et54). We confirmed the excess SFA/rigidity-to-excess PUFA/fluidity gradient using the methods of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and lipidomics analysis. The five strains were then studied for a variety of cellular and physiological traits and found to exhibit defects in: permeability, lipid peroxidation, growth at different temperatures, tolerance to SFA-rich diets, lifespan, brood size, vitellogenin trafficking, oogenesis, and autophagy during starvation. The excessively rigid strains often exhibited defects in opposite directions compared to the excessively fluid strains. We conclude that deviation from wild-type membrane homeostasis is pleiotropically deleterious for numerous cellular/physiological traits. The strains introduced here should prove useful to further study the cellular and physiological consequences of impaired membrane homeostasis.},

doi ={10.1038/s41467-021-25398-6},
abstract ={The contents of numerous membrane lipids change upon ageing. However, it is unknown whether and how any of these changes are causally linked to lifespan regulation. Acyl chains contribute to the functional specificity of membrane lipids. In this study, working with C. elegans, we identified an acyl chain-specific sphingolipid, C22 glucosylceramide, as a longevity metabolite. Germline deficiency, a conserved lifespan-extending paradigm, induces somatic expression of the fatty acid elongase ELO-3, and behenic acid (22:0) generated by ELO-3 is incorporated into glucosylceramide for lifespan regulation. Mechanistically, C22 glucosylceramide is required for the membrane localization of clathrin, a protein that regulates membrane budding. The reduction in C22 glucosylceramide impairs the clathrin-dependent autophagic lysosome reformation, which subsequently leads to TOR activation and longevity suppression. These findings reveal a mechanistic link between membrane lipids and ageing and suggest a model of lifespan regulation by fatty acid-mediated membrane configuration.},

title ={Dependence of Site-2 Protease Cleavage of ATF6 on Prior Site-1 Protease Digestion Is Determined by the Size of the Luminal Domain of ATF6},
year ={2004},
doi ={10.1074/jbc.M408466200},
abstract ={ATF6 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membraneanchored transcription factor activated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis in the ER stress response. The release of the cytosolic transcription factor domain of ATF6 requires the sequential processing by the Golgi site-1 and site-2 proteases (S1P and S2P). It has been unclear why S2P proteolysis relies on previous site-1 cleavage. One possibility is that S2P localizes to a different cellular compartment than S1P; however, here we show that S2P localizes to the same compartment as S1P, the cis/medial-Golgi. In addition, we have re-localized S1P and S2P to the ER with brefeldin A and find that the sequential cleavage of ATF6 is reconstituted in the ER. The mapping of the region of ATF6 required for sequential S1P and S2P cleavage showed that short luminal domains resulted in S1P-independent S2P cleavage. The addition of artificial domains onto these short ATF6 luminal domains restored the S1P dependence of S2P cleavage, suggesting that it is the size rather than specific sequences in the luminal domain that determines the S1P dependence of S2P cleavage. These results suggest that the bulky ATF6 luminal domain blocks S2P cleavage and that the role of S1P is to reduce the size of the luminal domain to prepare ATF6 to be an optimal S2P substrate.},

abstract ={The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest organelle of the cell and participates in multiple essential functions, including the production of secretory proteins, lipid synthesis, and calcium storage. Sustaining proteostasis requires an intimate coupling with energy production. Mitochondrial respiration evolved to be functionally connected to ER physiology through a physical interface between both organelles known as mitochondria-associated membranes. This quasi-synaptic structure acts as a signaling hub that tunes the function of both organelles in a bidirectional manner and controls proteostasis, cell death pathways, and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Here, we discuss the main signaling mechanisms governing interorganellar communication and their putative role in diseases including cancer and neurodegeneration.},

doi ={10.1101/2023.02.13.528342},
abstract ={The nuclear envelope (NE) is a subdomain of the ER with prominent roles in nuclear organization, largely mediated by its distinctive protein composition. We developed methods to reveal novel, low abundance transmembrane (TM) proteins concentrated at the NE relative to the peripheral ER. Using label-free proteomics that compared isolated NEs to cytoplasmic membranes, we first identified proteins with apparent NE enrichment. In subsequent authentication, ectopically expressed candidates were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy to quantify their targeting to the NE in cultured cells. Ten proteins from a validation set were found to associate preferentially with the NE, including oxidoreductases, enzymes for lipid biosynthesis and regulators of cell growth and survival. We determined that one of the validated candidates, the palmitoyltransferase Zdhhc6, modifies the NE oxidoreductase Tmx4 and thereby modulates its NE levels. This provides a functional rationale for the NE concentration of Zdhhc6. Overall, our methodology has revealed a group of previously unrecognized proteins concentrated at the NE and additional candidates. Future analysis of these can potentially unveil new mechanistic pathways associated with the NE.},

title ={Lysosomal recycling of amino acids affects ER quality control},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={Recent work has highlighted the fact that lysosomes are a critical signaling hub of metabolic processes, providing fundamental building blocks crucial for anabolic functions. How lysosomal functions affect other cellular compartments is not fully understood. Here, we find that lysosomal recycling of the amino acids lysine and arginine is essential for proper ER quality control through the UPR ER. Specifically, loss of the lysine and arginine amino acid transporter LAAT-1 results in increased sensitivity to proteotoxic stress in the ER and decreased animal physiology. We find that these LAAT-1-dependent effects are linked to glycine metabolism and transport and that the loss of function of the glycine transporter SKAT-1 also increases sensitivity to ER stress. Direct lysine and arginine supplementation, or glycine supplementation alone, can ameliorate increased ER stress sensitivity found in laat-1 mutants. These data implicate a crucial role in recycling lysine, arginine, and glycine in communication between the lysosome and ER.},

abstract ={p38 and c-Jun N-terninal kinase (JNK) are activated in response to acute stress and inflammatory signals. Through modification of a plethora of substrates, these kinases profoundly reshape cellular physiology for the optimal response to a harmful environment and/or an inflammatory state. Here, we utilized phospho-proteomics to identify several hundred substrates for both kinases. Our results indicate that the scale of signaling from p38 and JNK are of a similar magnitude. Among the many new targets, we highlight the regulation of the transcriptional regulators grb10-interacting GYF protein 1 and 2 (GIGYF1/2) by p38-dependent MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding. We also show that the Golgi apparatus contains numerous substrates, and is a major target for regulation by p38 and JNK. When activated, these kinases mediate structural rearrangement of the Golgi apparatus, which positively affects protein flux through the secretory system. Our work expands on our knowledge about p38 and JNK signaling with important biological ramifications.},

doi ={10.1002/1873-3468.13554},
abstract ={Organelles have been studied traditionally as single units, but a novel concept is now emerging: each organelle has distinct functional zones that regulate specific functions. The Golgi apparatus seems to have various zones, including zones for: glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins; proteoglycan, mucin and lipid glycosylation; transport of cholesterol and ceramides; protein degradation (Golgi membrane-associated degradation); and signalling for apoptosis. The capacity for these specific functions and the size of the corresponding zones appear to be tightly regulated by the Golgi stress response to accommodate cellular demands. For instance, the proteoglycan and mucin zones seem to be separately augmented during the differentiation of chondrocytes and goblet cells, respectively. The mammalian Golgi stress response consists of several response pathways. The TFE3 pathway regulates the general function of the Golgi, such as structural maintenance, N-glycosylation and vesicular transport, whereas the proteoglycan pathway increases the expression of glycosylation enzymes for proteoglycans. The CREB3 and HSP47 pathways regulate pro-and anti-apoptotic functions, respectively. These observations indicate that the Golgi is a dynamic organelle, the capacity of which is upregulated according to cellular needs.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1011078},
abstract ={Genetic networks are surprisingly robust to perturbations caused by new mutations. This robustness is conferred in part by compensation for loss of a gene's activity by genes with overlapping functions, such as paralogs. Compensation occurs passively when the normal activity of one paralog can compensate for the loss of the other, or actively when a change in one paralog's expression, localization, or activity is required to compensate for loss of the other. The mechanisms of active compensation remain poorly understood in most cases. Here we investigate active compensation for the loss or reduction in expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene TDH3 by its paralog TDH2. TDH2 is upregulated in a dosedependent manner in response to reductions in TDH3 by a mechanism requiring the shared transcriptional regulators Gcr1p and Rap1p. TDH1, a second and more distantly related paralog of TDH3, has diverged in its regulation and is upregulated by another mechanism. Other glycolytic genes regulated by Rap1p and Gcr1p show changes in expression similar to TDH2, suggesting that the active compensation by TDH3 paralogs is part of a broader homeostatic response mediated by shared transcriptional regulators.},

doi ={10.1091/mbc.E08},
abstract ={Despite extensive work on ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) 1 at the Golgi complex, the functions of Arf2-5 in the secretory pathway, or for that of any Arf at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) remain uncharacterized. Here, we examined the recruitment of fluorescently tagged Arf1,-3,-4, and-5 onto peripheral ERGIC. Live cell imaging detected Arfs on peripheral puncta that also contained Golgi-specific brefeldin A (BFA) resistance factor (GBF) 1 and the ERGIC marker p58. Unexpectedly, BFA did not promote corecruitment of Arfs with GBF1 either at the Golgi complex or the ERGIC, but it uncovered striking differences between Arf1,3 and Arf4,5. Although Arf1,3 quickly dissociated from all endomembranes after BFA addition, Arf4,5 persisted on ERGIC structures, even after redistribution of GBF1 to separate compartments. The GDP-arrested Arf4(T31N) mutant localized to the ERGIC, even with BFA and Exo1 present. In addtion, loss of Arf ⅐ GTP after treatment with Exo1 caused rapid release of all Arfs from the Golgi complex and led to GBF1 accumulation on both Golgi and ERGIC membranes. Our results demonstrate that GDP-bound Arf4,5 associate with ERGIC membranes through binding sites distinct from those responsible for GBF1 recruitment. Furthermore, they provide the first evidence that GBF1 accumulation on membranes may be caused by loss of Arf ⅐ GTP, rather than the formation of an Arf ⅐ GDP ⅐ BFA ⅐ GBF1 complex.},

While research into secretory stress signaling has so far mostly focused on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), emerging data suggest that the Golgi itself serves as an important signaling hub capable of initiating stress responses. To systematically identify novel Golgi stress mediators, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of cells exposed to three different pharmacological compounds known to elicit Golgi fragmentation: brefeldin A, golgicide A, and monensin. Subsequent gene-set enrichment analysis revealed a significant contribution of the ETS family transcription factors ELK1, GABPA/B, and ETS1 to the control of gene expression following compound treatment. Induction of Golgi stress leads to a late activation of the ETS upstream kinases MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, resulting in enhanced ETS factor activity and the transcription of ETS family target genes related to spliceosome function and cell death induction via alternate MCL1 splicing. Further genetic analyses using loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments suggest that these transcription factors operate in parallel.},

abstract ={Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death. This deterioration is the primary risk factor for major human pathologies including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Aging research has experienced an unprecedented advance over recent years, particularly with the discovery that the rate of aging is controlled, at least to some extent, by genetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. This review enumerates nine tentative hallmarks that represent common denominators of aging in different organisms, with special emphasis on mammalian aging. These hallmarks are: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient-sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. A major challenge is to dissect the interconnectedness between the candidate hallmarks and their relative contribution to aging, with the final goal of identifying pharmaceutical targets to improve human health during aging with minimal side-effects.},

Here, we report ultrastructural membrane expansion microscopy (umExM), which combines a novel membrane label and optimized expansion microscopy protocol, to support dense labeling of membranes in tissues for nanoscale visualization. We validated the high signal-to-background ratio, and uniformity and continuity, of umExM membrane labeling in brain slices, which supported the imaging of membranes and proteins at a resolution of ~60 nm on a confocal microscope. We demonstrated the utility of umExM for the segmentation and tracing of neuronal processes, such as axons, in mouse brain tissue. Combining umExM with optical fluctuation imaging, or iterating the expansion process, yielded ~35 nm resolution imaging, pointing towards the potential for electron microscopy resolution visualization of brain membranes on ordinary light microscopes.},

Mixed linear models with covariates age, ancestry and BMI were used to analyse the association between the A allele of rs373863828 and markers of insulin release and blood glucose regulation. Results The A allele of rs373863828 is associated with a greater increase in plasma insulin 30 min following a meal challenge without affecting the elevation in plasma glucose or incretins glucagon-like polypeptide-1 or gastric inhibitory polypeptide. Consistent with this point, following an i.v. infusion of a glucose bolus, participants with an A allele had higher early (p < 0.05 at 2 and 4 min) plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations for a similar elevation in blood glucose as those homozygous for the major (G) allele. Despite increased plasma insulin, rs373863828 genotype was not associated with a significant difference (p > 0.05) in insulin sensitivity index or glucose disposal during hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. Conclusions/interpretation rs373863828-A allele associates with increased glucose-stimulated insulin release without affecting insulin sensitivity, suggesting that CREBRF p.Arg457Gln may increase insulin release to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.},

title ={MLX Is a Transcriptional Repressor of the Mammalian Golgi Stress Response},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={The Golgi stress response is a homeostatic mechanism that controls the capacity of the Golgi apparatus in accordance with cellular demands. When the capacity of the Golgi apparatus becomes insufficient (Golgi stress), transcription levels of Golgi-related genes encoding glycosylation enzymes, a Golgi structural protein, and components of vesicular transport are upregulated through a common cis-acting enhancer-the Golgi apparatus stress response element (GASE). Here, we identified the transcription factor MLX as a GASEbinding protein. MLX resides in the cytoplasm and does not bind to GASE in normal growth conditions, whereas MLX translocates into the nucleus and specifically binds to GASE in response to Golgi stress. Suppression of MLX expression increased transcriptional induction of target genes of the Golgi stress response, whereas overexpression of MLX reduced GASE-binding of TFE3 as well as transcriptional induction from GASE, suggesting that MLX is a transcriptional repressor of the mammalian Golgi stress response.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1083/jcb.202102122},
abstract ={In eukaryote cells, lipid droplets (LDs) are key intracellular organelles that dynamically regulate cellular energy homeostasis. LDs originate from the ER and continuously contact the ER during their growth. How the ER affects LD growth is largely unknown. Here, we show that RNAi knockdown of acs-1, encoding an acyl-CoA synthetase required for the biosynthesis of monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids C15iso and C17iso, remarkably prevented LD growth in Caenorhabditis elegans. Dietary C17iso, or complex lipids with C17iso including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and triacylglycerol, could fully restore the LD growth in the acs-1RNAi worms. Mechanistically, C17iso may incorporate into phospholipids to ensure the membrane integrity of the ER so as to maintain the function of ER-resident enzymes such as SCD/stearoyl-CoA desaturase and DGAT2/diacylglycerol acyltransferase for appropriate lipid synthesis and LD growth. Collectively, our work uncovers a unique fatty acid, C17iso, as the side chain of phospholipids for determining the ER homeostasis for LD growth in an intact organism, C. elegans. .},

year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={The transport of apolipoprotein B (apoB) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi was studied in puromycin-synchronized HepG2 cells, using an antibody that could distinguish between apoB in ER and Golgi compartments. In cells with normal ER-to-Golgi transport, both albumin and apoB colocalized throughout the ER and appeared as intense, compact signals in Golgi. When ER-to-Golgi transport was blocked with brefeldin A, apoB and albumin remained colocalized in the ER network and threedimensional constructed images showed more intense signals for both proteins in a central, perinuclear region of the ER. When protein synthesis was stopped in cells with brefeldin A-inhibited ER-to-Golgi transport, apoB degradation was visualized as a homogeneous decrease in fluorescence signal intensity throughout the ER that could be slowed with clasto-lactacystin ␤-lactone, a proteasome inhibitor. Incubation of cells with CP-10447, an inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, inhibited apoB, but not albumin, transport from ER to Golgi. Nanogold immunoelectron microscopy of digitonin-permeabilized cells showed proteasomes in close proximity to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. Thus, newly synthesized apoB is localized throughout the entire ER and degraded homogeneously, most likely by neighboring proteasomes located on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. Although albumin is colocalized with apoB in the ER, as expected, it was not targeted for ER-associated proteasomal degradation.-Sakata, N., T. E.},

year ={2000},
doi ={},
abstract ={The positional relationships among all of the visible organelles in a densely packed region of cytoplasm from an insulin secreting, cultured mammalian cell have been analyzed in three dimensions (3-D) at Ϸ6 nm resolution. Part of a fast frozen͞freeze-substituted HIT-T15 cell that included a large portion of the Golgi ribbon was reconstructed in 3-D by electron tomography. The reconstructed volume (3.1 ؋ 3.2 ؋ 1.2 m 3) allowed sites of interaction between organelles, and between microtubules and organellar membranes, to be accurately defined in 3-D and quantitatively analyzed by spatial density analyses. Our data confirm that the Golgi in an interphase mammalian cell is a single, ribbon-like organelle composed of stacks of flattened cisternae punctuated by openings of various sizes [Rambourg, A., Clermont, Y., & Hermo, L. (1979) Am. J. Anat. 154, 455-476]. The data also show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a single continuous compartment that forms close contacts with mitochondria, multiple trans Golgi cisternae, and compartments of the endo-lysosomal system. This ER traverses the Golgi ribbon from one side to the other via cisternal openings. Microtubules form close, non-random associations with the cis Golgi, the ER, and endo-lysosomal compartments. Despite the dense packing of organelles in this Golgi region, Ϸ66% of the reconstructed volume is calculated to represent cytoplasmic matrix. We relate the intimacy of structural associations between organelles in the Golgi region, as quantified by spatial density analyses, to biochemical mechanisms for membrane trafficking and organellar communication in mammalian cells.},

abstract ={The E3 ubiquitin ligases CHIP/CHN-1 and UFD-2 team up to accelerate ubiquitin chain formation. However, it remained largely unclear how the high processivity of this E3 set is achieved. Here we studied the molecular mechanism and function of the CHN-1/UFD-2 complex in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our data show that UFD-2 binding promotes the cooperation between CHN-1 and ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzymes by stabilizing the CHN-1 U-box dimer. The HSP-1 chaperone outcompetes UFD-2 for CHN-1 binding and promotes the auto-inhibited CHN-1 state by acting on the conserved position of the U-box domain. The interaction with UFD-2 enables CHN-1 to efficiently ubiquitinate S-Adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY-1), an enzyme crucial for lipid metabolism. Our results define the molecular mechanism underlying the synergistic cooperation of CHN-1 and UFD-2 in substrate ubiquitylation.},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.3390/cells9020261},
abstract ={Immunosenescence in monocytes has been shown to be associated with several biochemical and functional changes, including development of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which may be inhibited by klotho protein. To date, it was believed that SASP activation is associated with accumulating DNA damage. However, some literature data suggest that endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi stress pathways may be involved in SASP development. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of klotho protein in the regulation of immunosenescence-associated Golgi apparatus and ER stress response induced by bacterial antigens in monocytes. We provide evidence that initiation of immunosenescent-like phenotype in monocytes is accompanied by activation of CREB34L and TFE3 Golgi stress response and ATF6 and IRE1 endoplasmic reticulum stress response, while klotho overexpression prevents these changes. Further, these changes are followed by upregulated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, which final modification takes place exclusively in the Golgi apparatus. In conclusion, we provide for the first time evidence of klotho involvement in the crosstalk on the line ER-Golgi, which may, in turn, affect activation of SASP. This data may be useful for a novel potential target for therapy in age-related and chronic inflammatory conditions.},

abstract ={In eukaryotic cells, organelle-specific stress-response mechanisms are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The Golgi apparatus, an essential organelle of the secretory system, is the major site of protein modification and sorting within a cell and functions as a platform for spatially regulated signaling. Golgi homeostasis mechanisms that regulate organelle structure and ensure precise processing and localization of protein substrates remain poorly understood. Using a chemical biology strategy to induce protein unfolding, we uncover a Golgi-specific transcriptional response. An RNA-sequencing profile of this stress response compared with the current state-of-the-art Golgi stressors, nigericin and xyloside, demonstrates the enhanced precision of Golgi targeting achieved with our system. The data set further reveals previously uncharacterized genes that we find to be essential for Golgi structural integrity. These findings highlight the Golgi's ability to sense misfolded proteins and establish new aspects of Golgi autoregulation.},

abstract ={Lipidomics is of growing importance for clinical and biomedical research due to many associations between lipid metabolism and diseases. The discovery of these associations is facilitated by improved lipid identification and quantification. Sophisticated computational methods are advantageous for interpreting such large-scale data for understanding metabolic processes and their underlying (patho)mechanisms. To generate hypothesis about these mechanisms, the combination of metabolic networks and graph algorithms is a powerful option to pinpoint molecular disease drivers and their interactions. Here we present LINEX 2 (Lipid Network Explorer), a lipid network analysis framework that fuels biological interpretation of alterations in lipid compositions. By integrating lipid-metabolic reactions from public databases we generate dataset-specific lipid interaction networks. To aid interpretation of these networks we present an enrichment graph algorithm that infers changes in enzymatic activity in the context of their multispecificity from lipidomics data. Our inference method successfully recovered the MBOAT7 enzyme from knockout data. Furthermore, we mechanistically interpret lipidomic alterations of adipocytes in obesity by leveraging network enrichment and lipid moieties. We address the general lack of lipidomics data mining options to elucidate potential disease mechanisms and make lipidomics more clinically relevant.},

abstract ={The Golgi apparatus lies at the heart of the secretory pathway where it receives, modifies, and sorts protein cargo to the proper intracellular or extracellular location. Although this secretory function is highly conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom, the structure of the Golgi complex is arranged very differently among species. In particular, Golgi membranes in vertebrate cells are integrated into a single compact entity termed the Golgi ribbon that is normally localized in the perinuclear area and in close vicinity to the centrosomes. This organization poses a challenge for cell division when the single Golgi ribbon needs to be partitioned into the two daughter cells. To ensure faithful inheritance in the progeny, the Golgi ribbon is divided in three consecutive steps in mitosis, namely disassembly, partitioning, and reassembly. However, the structure of the Golgi ribbon is only present in higher animals and Golgi disassembly during mitosis is not ubiquitous in all organisms. Therefore, there must be unique reasons to build up the Golgi in this particular conformation and to preserve it over generations. In this review, we first highlight the diversity of the Golgi architecture in different organisms and revisit the concept of the Golgi ribbon. Following on, we discuss why the ribbon is needed and how it forms in vertebrate cells. Lastly, we conclude with likely purposes of mitotic ribbon disassembly and further propose mechanisms by which it regulates mitosis.},

title ={Nuclear lipid droplets and nuclear damage in Caenorhabditis elegans},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1009602},
abstract ={Fat stored in the form of lipid droplets has long been considered a defining characteristic of cytoplasm. However, recent studies have shown that nuclear lipid droplets occur in multiple cells and tissues, including in human patients with fatty liver disease. The function(s) of stored fat in the nucleus has not been determined, and it is possible that nuclear fat is beneficial in some situations. Conversely, nuclear lipid droplets might instead be deleterious by disrupting nuclear organization or triggering aggregation of hydrophobic proteins. We show here that nuclear lipid droplets occur normally in C. elegans intestinal cells and germ cells, but appear to be associated with damage only in the intestine. Lipid droplets in intestinal nuclei can be associated with novel bundles of microfilaments (nuclear actin) and membrane tubules that might have roles in damage repair. To increase the normal, low frequency of nuclear lipid droplets in wild-type animals, we used a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants with abnormally large or abundant nuclear lipid droplets. Genetic analysis and cloning of three such mutants showed that the genes encode the lipid regulator SEIP-1/seipin, the inner nuclear membrane protein NEMP-1/Nemp1/TMEM194A, and a component of COPI vesicles called COPA-1/α-COP. We present several lines of evidence that the nuclear lipid droplet phenotype of copa-1 mutants results from a defect in retrieving mislocalized membrane proteins that normally reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. The seip-1 mutant causes most germ cells to have nuclear lipid droplets, the largest of which occupy more than a third of the nuclear volume. Nevertheless, the nuclear lipid droplets do not trigger apoptosis, and the germ cells differentiate into gametes that produce viable, healthy progeny. Thus, our results suggest that nuclear lipid droplets are detrimental to intestinal nuclei, but have no obvious deleterious effect on germ nuclei.},

abstract ={Vesicles formed by the COPI complex function in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein b (PITPb), an essential protein that possesses phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) lipid transfer activity is known to localise to the Golgi and ER but its role in these membrane systems is not clear. To examine the function of PITPb at the Golgi-ER interface, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to knockdown PITPb protein expression in HeLa cells. Depletion of PITPb leads to a decrease in PtdIns(4)P levels, compaction of the Golgi complex and protection from brefeldin-Amediated dispersal to the ER. Using specific transport assays, we show that anterograde traffic is unaffected but that KDEL-receptordependent retrograde traffic is inhibited. This phenotype can be rescued by expression of wild-type PITPb but not by mutants defective in docking, PtdIns transfer and PtdCho transfer. These data demonstrate that the PtdIns and PtdCho exchange activity of PITPb is essential for COPI-mediated retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER.},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.1083/jcb.202004191},
abstract ={2014). However, these studies addressed the effect of depleting either only one of the two GORASP orthologues. In the mouse knockout of GORASP1 that failed to detect an obvious effect on Golgi stacking (Veenendaal et al., 2014), the levels of GORASP2 were unaffected, which raises the possibility of a functional redundancy. To address redundancy, Wang and colleagues used CRISPR-Cas9 to completely deplete GORASPs in HeLa and HEK293 cells, but these alterations led to a significant reduction (up to 75-80% of the control levels) of GM130 and golgin-45 proteins (Bekier et al., 2017). Fluorescence microscopy-based analysis with antibodies to GM130 and the late Golgi transmembrane protein TGN46 revealed that these membrane components were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm instead of localized at the Golgi as in control cells. Not clear, therefore, was whether this was due to loss of GORASPs, loss of 75-80% of GM130, golgin-45, or perhaps loss of another cellular component that might be depleted by these procedures (see Fig. 4 in Bekier et al., 2017).},

title ={Lipid-anchored proteasomes control membrane protein homeostasis},
year ={2024},
doi ={},
abstract ={Protein degradation in eukaryotic cells is mainly carried out by the 26S proteasome, a macromolecular complex not only present in the cytosol and nucleus but also associated with various membranes. How proteasomes are anchored to the membrane and the biological meaning thereof have been largely unknown in higher organisms. Here, we show that N-myristoylation of the Rpt2 subunit is a general mechanism for proteasome-membrane interaction. Loss of this modification in the Rpt2-G2A mutant cells leads to profound changes in the membrane-associated proteome, perturbs the endomembrane system, and undermines critical cellular processes such as cell adhesion, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and membrane protein trafficking. Rpt2 G2A/G2A homozygous mutation is embryonic lethal in mice and is sufficient to abolish tumor growth in a nude mice xenograft model. These findings have defined an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for maintaining membrane protein homeostasis and underscored the significance of compartmentalized protein degradation by myristoyl-anchored proteasomes in health and disease.},

title ={Mitochondria-derived nuclear ATP surge protects against confinement-induced proliferation defects},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.12.20.572417},
abstract ={The physical microenvironment regulates cell behaviour. However, whether physical confinement rewires the subcellular localisation of organelles and affect metabolism is unknown. Proteomics analysis revealed that cellular confinement induces a strong enrichment of mitochondrial proteins within the nuclear compartment. High-resolution microscopy confirmed that mechanical cell confinement leads to a rapid relocalisation of mitochondria to the nuclear periphery. This nuclear-mitochondrial proximity is mediated by an endoplasmic reticulum-based net that entraps the mitochondria in an actin-dependent manner. Functionally, the mitochondrial proximity results in a nuclear ATP surge, which can be reverted by the pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial ATP production or via actin depolymerisation. Inhibition of the confinement-derived nuclear ATP surge reveals long-term effects on cell fitness which arise from alterations of chromatin states, delayed DNA damage repair, and impaired cell cycle progression. Together, our data describe a confinement-induced metabolic adaptation that is required to enable prompt DNA damage repair and cell cycle progression by allowing chromatin state transitions.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1101/2022.06.27.497668},
abstract ={Vitellogenins (VITs) are the most abundant proteins in adult hermaphrodite C. elegans. VITs are synthesized in the intestine, secreted to the pseudocoelom, matured into yolk proteins (YPs), and finally deposited in oocytes to support embryonic and larval development. How VITs are secreted out of the intestine remains unclear. In this study, we use immuno-electron microscopy (immuno-EM) to characterize the wild-type subcellular structures containing VITs or YPs. In the intestinal cells of young adult worms, we identify VITs along an exocytic pathway consisting of the rough ER, the Golgi, and the lipid bilayer bounded vesicles, which we call intestinal vitellogenin vesicles (VVs). This suggests that the classic exocytotic pathway mediates secretion of VITs from the intestine to the pseudocoelom. We also show that pseudocoelomic yolk patches (PYPs) are membrane-less and amorphous. The different VITs/YPs are packed as a mixture into the above structures. The size of VVs can vary with the VIT levels and the age of the worm. On adult day 2 (AD 2), intestinal VVs (~200 nm in diameter) are smaller than gonadal yolk organelles (YOs, ~500 nm in diameter). VVs, PYPs, and YOs share a uniform, medium electron density by conventional EM. The morphological profiles documented in this study can serve as a reference for future studies of VITs/YPs. Surveying the findings from this study and elsewhere, we review in the discussion the post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions of C. elegans VITs/YPs.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1083/jcb.202106100},
abstract ={ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) are small GTPases regulating membrane traffic in the secretory pathway. They are closely related and appear to have overlapping functions, regulators, and effectors. The functional specificity of individual Arfs and the extent of redundancy are still largely unknown. We addressed these questions by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic deletion of the human class I (Arf1/3) and class II (Arf4/5) Arfs, either individually or in combination. Most knockout cell lines were viable with slight growth defects only when lacking Arf1 or Arf4. However, Arf1+4 and Arf4+5 could not be deleted simultaneously. Class I Arfs are nonessential, and Arf4 alone is sufficient for viability. Upon Arf1 deletion, the Golgi was enlarged, and recruitment of vesicle coats decreased, confirming a major role of Arf1 in vesicle formation at the Golgi. Knockout of Arf4 caused secretion of ER-resident proteins, indicating specific defects in coatomer-dependent ER protein retrieval by KDEL receptors. The knockout cell lines will be useful tools to study other Arf-dependent processes. .},

abstract ={Contact sites are areas of close apposition between two membranes that coordinate nonvesicular communication between organelles. Such interactions serve a wide range of cellular functions from regulating metabolic pathways to executing stress responses and coordinating organelle inheritance. The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in information on certain contact sites, mostly those involving the endoplasmic reticulum. However, despite its central role in the secretory pathway, the Golgi apparatus and its contact sites remain largely unexplored. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of Golgi contact sites and share our thoughts as to why Golgi contact sites are understudied. We also highlight what exciting future directions may exist in this emerging field.},

abstract ={The Golgi is a dynamic organelle whose correct assembly is crucial for cellular homeostasis. Perturbations in Golgi structure are associated with numerous disorders from neurodegeneration to cancer. However, whether and how dispersal of the Golgi apparatus is actively regulated under stress, and the consequences of Golgi dispersal, remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that 26S proteasomes are associated with the cytosolic surface of Golgi membranes to facilitate Golgi Apparatus-Related Degradation (GARD) and degradation of GM130 in response to Golgi stress. The degradation of GM130 is dependent on p97/VCP and 26S proteasomes, and required for Golgi dispersal. Finally, we show that perturbation of Golgi homeostasis induces cell death of multiple myeloma in vitro and in vivo, offering a therapeutic strategy for this malignancy. Taken together, this work reveals a mechanism of Golgi-localized proteasomal degradation, providing a functional link between proteostasis control and Golgi architecture, which may be critical in various secretion-related pathologies.},

title ={Ubiquitination drives COPI priming and Golgi SNARE localization},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.80911},
abstract ={Deciphering mechanisms controlling SNARE localization within the Golgi complex is crucial to understanding protein trafficking patterns within the secretory pathway. SNAREs are also thought to prime coatomer protein I (COPI) assembly to ensure incorporation of these essential cargoes into vesicles, but the regulation of these events is poorly understood. Here, we report roles for ubiquitin recognition by COPI in SNARE trafficking and in stabilizing interactions between Arf, COPI, and Golgi SNAREs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ability of COPI to bind ubiquitin, but not the dilysine motif, through its N-terminal WD repeat domain of β′-COP or through an unrelated ubiquitin-binding domain is essential for the proper localization of Golgi SNAREs Bet1 and Gos1. We find that COPI, the ArfGAP Glo3, and multiple Golgi SNAREs are ubiquitinated. Notably, the binding of Arf and COPI to Gos1 is markedly enhanced by ubiquitination of these components. Glo3 is proposed to prime COPI-SNARE interactions; however, Glo3 is not enriched in the ubiquitin-stabilized SNARE-Arf-COPI complex but is instead enriched with COPI complexes that lack SNAREs. These results support a new model for how posttranslational modifications drive COPI priming events crucial for Golgi SNARE localization. Editor's evaluation This article will be of interest for cell biologists focused on understanding membrane biology, trafficking, and protein ubiquitination, as well as yeast geneticists. The main finding of this paper is that non-degradative ubiquitination is an important mechanism driving COPI-dependent SNARE trafficking and localization.},

year ={2024},
doi ={},
abstract ={Repurposing drugs as treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has drawn much attention. Beginning with sigma receptor ligands and expanding to other drugs from screening in the field, we became concerned that phospholipidosis was a shared mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of many repurposed drugs. For all of the 23 cationic amphiphilic drugs we tested, including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, amiodarone, and four others already in clinical trials, phospholipidosis was monotonically correlated with antiviral efficacy. Conversely, drugs active against the same targets that did not induce phospholipidosis were not antiviral. Phospholipidosis depends on the physicochemical properties of drugs and does not reflect specific targetbased activities-rather, it may be considered a toxic confound in early drug discovery. Early detection of phospholipidosis could eliminate these artifacts, enabling a focus on molecules with therapeutic potential.},

title ={Origin of gradients in lipid density and surface tension between connected lipid droplet and bilayer},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1016/j.bpj.2021.11.022},
abstract ={We combined theory and experiments to depict physical parameters modulating the phospholipid (PL) density and tension equilibrium between a bilayer and an oil droplet in contiguity. This situation is encountered during a neutral lipid (NL) droplet formation in the endoplasmic reticulum. We set up macroscopic and microscopic models to uncover free parameters and the origin of molecular interactions controlling the PL densities of the droplet monolayer and the bilayer. The established physical laws and predictions agreed with experiments performed with droplet-embedded vesicles. We found that the droplet monolayer is always by a few percent ($10%) less packed with PLs than the bilayer. Such a density gradient arises from PL-NL interactions on the droplet, which are lower than PL-PL trans interactions in the bilayer, i.e., interactions between PLs belonging to different leaflets of the bilayer. Finally, despite the pseudo-surface tension for the water/PL acyl chains in the bilayer being higher than the water/NL surface tension, the droplet monolayer always has a higher surface tension than the bilayer because of its lower PL density. Thus, a PL density gradient is mandatory to maintain the mechanical and thermodynamic equilibrium of the droplet-bilayer continuity. Our study sheds light on the origin of the molecular interactions responsible for the unique surface properties of lipid droplets compared with cellular bilayer membranes.},

The UPR itself consists of very complex pathways that function to not only maintain protein homeostasis, but just as importantly, modulate lipid biogenesis to allow the ER to adjust and promote cell survival.

doi ={10.1021/acs.chemrev.3c00608},
abstract ={It is well-known that aqueous dispersions of phospholipids spontaneously assemble into bilayer structures. These structures have numerous applications across chemistry and materials science and form the fundamental structural unit of the biological membrane. The particular environment of the lipid bilayer, with a water-poor low dielectric core surrounded by a more polar and better hydrated interfacial region, gives the membrane particular biophysical and physicochemical properties and presents a unique environment for chemical reactions to occur. Many different types of molecule spanning a range of sizes, from dissolved gases through small organics to proteins, are able to interact with membranes and promote chemical changes to lipids that subsequently affect the physicochemical properties of the bilayer. This Review describes the chemical reactivity exhibited by lipids in their membrane form, with an emphasis on conditions where the lipids are well hydrated in the form of bilayers. Key topics include the following: lytic reactions of glyceryl esters, including hydrolysis, aminolysis, and transesterification; oxidation reactions of alkenes in unsaturated fatty acids and sterols, including autoxidation and oxidation by singlet oxygen; reactivity of headgroups, particularly with reactive carbonyl species; and E/Z isomerization of alkenes. The consequences of reactivity for biological activity and biophysical properties are also discussed. CONTENTS},

title ={Membrane phospholipid alteration causes chronic ER stress through early degradation of homeostatic ER-resident proteins},
year ={2019},
doi ={10.1038/s41598-019-45020-6},
abstract ={phospholipid homeostasis in biological membranes is essential to maintain functions of organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum. phospholipid perturbation has been associated to cellular stress responses. However, in most cases, the implication of membrane lipid changes to homeostatic cellular response has not been clearly defined. Previously, we reported that Saccharomyces cerevisiae adapts to lipid bilayer stress by upregulating several protein quality control pathways such as the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (eRAD) pathway and the unfolded protein response (UpR). surprisingly, we observed certain eR-resident transmembrane proteins, which form part of the UpR programme, to be destabilised under lipid bilayer stress. Among these, the protein translocon subunit Sbh1 was prematurely degraded by membrane stiffening at the ER. Moreover, our findings suggest that the Doa10 complex recognises free Sbh1 that becomes increasingly accessible during lipid bilayer stress, perhaps due to the change in eR membrane properties. premature removal of key eR-resident transmembrane proteins might be an underlying cause of chronic eR stress as a result of lipid bilayer stress.},

doi ={10.7554/eLife.24603.001},
abstract ={The flat Golgi cisterna is a highly conserved feature of eukaryotic cells, but how is this morphology achieved and is it related to its function in cargo sorting and export? A physical model of cisterna morphology led us to propose that sphingomyelin (SM) metabolism at the trans-Golgi membranes in mammalian cells essentially controls the structural features of a Golgi cisterna by regulating its association to curvature-generating proteins. An experimental test of this hypothesis revealed that affecting SM homeostasis converted flat cisternae into highly curled membranes with a concomitant dissociation of membrane curvature-generating proteins. These data lend support to our hypothesis that SM metabolism controls the structural organization of a Golgi cisterna. Together with our previously presented role of SM in controlling the location of proteins involved in glycosylation and vesicle formation, our data reveal the significance of SM metabolism in the structural organization and function of Golgi cisternae.},

year ={2007},
doi ={10.1038/sj.emboj.7601712},
abstract ={It is currently unknown how extensively the doublestranded RNA-binding protein Staufen (Stau)1 is utilized by mammalian cells to regulate gene expression. To date, Stau1 binding to the 3 0-untranslated region (3 0-UTR) of ADP ribosylation factor (ARF)1 mRNA has been shown to target ARF1 mRNA for Stau1-mediated mRNA decay (SMD). ARF1 SMD depends on translation and recruitment of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay factor Upf1 to the ARF1 3 0-UTR by Stau1. Here, we demonstrate that Stau1 binds to a complex structure within the ARF1 3 0-UTR. We also use microarrays to show that 1.1 and 1.0% of the 11 569 HeLa-cell transcripts that were analyzed are upregulated and downregulated, respectively, at least twofold upon Stau1 depletion in three independently performed experiments. We localize the Stau1 binding site to the 3 0-UTR of four mRNAs that we define as natural SMD targets. Additionally, we provide evidence that the efficiency of SMD increases during the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts to myotubes. We propose that Stau1 influences the expression of a wide variety of physiologic transcripts and metabolic pathways.},

abstract ={Cellular membranes contain numerous lipid species, and efforts to understand the biological functions of individual lipids have been stymied by a lack of approaches for controlled modulation of membrane composition in situ. Here we present a strategy for editing phospholipids, the most abundant lipids in biological membranes. Our membrane editor is based on a bacterial phospholipase D (PLD), which exchanges phospholipid head groups through hydrolysis or transphosphatidylation of phosphatidylcholine with water or exogenous alcohols. Exploiting activity-dependent directed enzyme evolution in mammalian cells, we have developed and structurally characterized a family of 'superPLDs' with up to a 100-fold enhancement in intracellular activity. We demonstrate the utility of superPLDs for both optogenetics-enabled editing of phospholipids within specific organelle membranes in live cells and biocatalytic synthesis of natural and unnatural designer phospholipids in vitro. Beyond the superPLDs, activity-based directed enzyme evolution in mammalian cells is a generalizable approach to engineer additional chemoenzymatic biomolecule editors.},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.1016/j.jnutbio.2020.108381},
abstract ={One-carbon metabolism is a collection of metabolic cycles that supports methylation and provides one-carbon bound folates for the de novo synthesis purine and thymidine nucleotides. The methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine to form choline has been extensively studied in the context of fatty liver disease. However, the role of one-carbon metabolism in supporting nucleotide synthesis during liver damage has not been addressed. The objective of this study is to determine how the disruption of one-carbon metabolism influences nucleotide metabolism in the liver after dietary methionine and choline restriction. Mice (n=8) were fed a methionine-choline-deficient or control diet for 3 weeks. We treated mice with the compound alloxazine (0.5 mg/kg), a known adenosine receptor antagonist, every second day during the final week of feeding to probe the function of adenosine signaling during liver damage. We found that concentrations of several hepatic nucleotides were significantly lower in methionine-and choline-deficient mice vs. controls (adenine: 13.9±0.7 vs. 10.1±0.6, guanine: 1.8±0.1 vs. 1.4±0.1, thymidine: 0.0122±0.0027 vs. 0.0059±0.0027 nmol/mg dry tissue). Treatment of alloxazine caused a specific decrease thymidine nucleotides, decrease in mitochondrial content in the liver and exacerbation of steatohepatitis as shown by the increased hepatic lipid content and altered macrophage morphology. This study demonstrates a role for one-carbon metabolism in supporting de novo nucleotide synthesis and mitochondrial function during liver damage.},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-019-14038-9},
abstract ={The Golgi is a dynamic organelle whose correct assembly is crucial for cellular homeostasis. Perturbations in Golgi structure are associated with numerous disorders from neurodegeneration to cancer. However, whether and how dispersal of the Golgi apparatus is actively regulated under stress, and the consequences of Golgi dispersal, remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that 26S proteasomes are associated with the cytosolic surface of Golgi membranes to facilitate Golgi Apparatus-Related Degradation (GARD) and degradation of GM130 in response to Golgi stress. The degradation of GM130 is dependent on p97/VCP and 26S proteasomes, and required for Golgi dispersal. Finally, we show that perturbation of Golgi homeostasis induces cell death of multiple myeloma in vitro and in vivo, offering a therapeutic strategy for this malignancy. Taken together, this work reveals a mechanism of Golgi-localized proteasomal degradation, providing a functional link between proteostasis control and Golgi architecture, which may be critical in various secretion-related pathologies.},

abstract ={Recent advances in single-cell genomics and transcriptomics technologies have transformed our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in growth, development, ageing, and disease; however, methods for single-cell lipidomics have comparatively lagged behind in development. We have developed a method for the detection and quantification of a wide range of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin species from single cells that combines fluorescence-assisted cell sorting with automated chip-based nanoESI and shotgun lipidomics. We show herein that our method is capable of quantifying more than 50 different phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin species from single cells and can easily distinguish between cells of different lineages or cells treated with exogenous fatty acids. Moreover, our method can detect more subtle differences in the lipidome between cell lines of the same cancer type. Our approach can be run in parallel with other single-cell technologies to deliver near-complete, high-throughput multi-omics data on cells with a similar phenotype and has the capacity to significantly advance our current knowledge on cellular heterogeneity.},

title ={Unsupervised Deep Learning Can Identify Protein Functional Groups from Unaligned Sequences},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1093/gbe/evad084},
abstract ={Interpreting protein function from sequence data is a fundamental goal of bioinformatics. However, our current understanding of protein diversity is bottlenecked by the fact that most proteins have only been functionally validated in model organisms, limiting our understanding of how function varies with gene sequence diversity. Thus, accuracy of inferences in clades without model representatives is questionable. Unsupervised learning may help to ameliorate this bias by identifying highly complex patterns and structure from large data sets without external labels. Here, we present DeepSeqProt, an unsupervised deep learning program for exploring large protein sequence data sets. DeepSeqProt is a clustering tool capable of distinguishing between broad classes of proteins while learning local and global structure of functional space. DeepSeqProt is capable of learning salient biological features from unaligned, unannotated sequences. DeepSeqProt is more likely to capture complete protein families and statistically significant shared ontologies within proteomes than other clustering methods. We hope this framework will prove of use to researchers and provide a preliminary step in further developing unsupervised deep learning in molecular biology.},

doi ={10.15252/msb.202211443},
abstract ={Metabolism is controlled to ensure organismal development and homeostasis. Several mechanisms regulate metabolism, including allosteric control and transcriptional regulation of metabolic enzymes and transporters. So far, metabolism regulation has mostly been described for individual genes and pathways, and the extent of transcriptional regulation of the entire metabolic network remains largely unknown. Here, we find that three-quarters of all metabolic genes are transcriptionally regulated in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that many annotated metabolic pathways are coexpressed, and we use gene expression data and the iCEL1314 metabolic network model to define coregulated subpathways in an unbiased manner. Using a large gene expression compendium, we determine the conditions where subpathways exhibit strong coexpression. Finally, we develop "WormClust," a web application that enables a gene-by-gene query of genes to view their association with metabolic (sub)-pathways. Overall, this study sheds light on the ubiquity of transcriptional regulation of metabolism and provides a blueprint for similar studies in other organisms, including humans.},

title ={RNAlysis: analyze your RNA sequencing data without writing a single line of code},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1186/s12915-023-01574-6},
abstract ={Background Among the major challenges in next-generation sequencing experiments are exploratory data analysis, interpreting trends, identifying potential targets/candidates, and visualizing the results clearly and intuitively. These hurdles are further heightened for researchers who are not experienced in writing computer code since most available analysis tools require programming skills. Even for proficient computational biologists, an efficient and replicable system is warranted to generate standardized results. Results We have developed RNAlysis, a modular Python-based analysis software for RNA sequencing data. RNAlysis allows users to build customized analysis pipelines suiting their specific research questions, going all the way from raw FASTQ files (adapter trimming, alignment, and feature counting), through exploratory data analysis and data visualization, clustering analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis. RNAlysis provides a friendly graphical user interface, allowing researchers to analyze data without writing code. We demonstrate the use of RNAlysis by analyzing RNA sequencing data from different studies using C. elegans nematodes. We note that the software applies equally to data obtained from any organism with an existing reference genome. Conclusions RNAlysis is suitable for investigating various biological questions, allowing researchers to more accurately and reproducibly run comprehensive bioinformatic analyses. It functions as a gateway into RNA sequencing analysis for less computer-savvy researchers, but can also help experienced bioinformaticians make their analyses more robust and efficient, as it offers diverse tools, scalability, automation, and standardization between analyses.},

abstract ={RNA-seq is now the technology of choice for genome-wide differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear how many biological replicates are needed to ensure valid biological interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20%-40% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to >85% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve >85% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at ≲5% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.},

title ={OrthoSNAP: A tree splitting and pruning algorithm for retrieving single-copy orthologs from gene family trees},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pbio.3001827},
abstract ={AU : Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly: Molecular evolution studies, such as phylogenomic studies and genome-wide surveys of selection, often rely on gene families of single-copy orthologs (SC-OGs). Large gene families with multiple homologs in 1 or more species-a phenomenon observed among several important families of genes such as transporters and transcription factors-are often ignored because identifying and retrieving SC-OGs nested within them is challenging. To address this issue and increase the number of markers used in molecular evolution studies, we developed OrthoSNAP, a software that uses a phylogenetic framework to simultaneously split gene families into SC-OGs and prune species-specific inparalogs. We term SC-OGs identified by OrthoSNAP as SNAP-OGs because they are identified using a splitting and pruning procedure analogous to snapping branches on a tree. From 415,129 orthologous groups of genes inferred across 7 eukaryotic phylogenomic datasets, we identified 9,821 SC-OGs; using OrthoSNAP on the remaining 405,308 orthologous groups of genes, we identified an additional 10,704 SNAP-OGs. Comparison of SNAP-OGs and SC-OGs revealed that their phylogenetic information content was similar, even in complex datasets that contain a whole-genome duplication, complex patterns of duplication and loss, transcriptome data where each gene typically has multiple transcripts, and contentious branches in the tree of life. OrthoSNAP is useful for increasing the number of markers used in molecular evolution data matrices, a critical step for robustly inferring and exploring the tree of life.},

doi ={10.1038/s41587-023-02097-9},
abstract ={Computational methods for integrating single-cell transcriptomic data from multiple samples and conditions do not generally account for imbalances in the cell types measured in different datasets. In this study, we examined how differences in the cell types present, the number of cells per cell type and the cell type proportions across samples affect downstream analyses after integration. The Iniquitate pipeline assesses the robustness of integration results after perturbing the degree of imbalance between datasets. Benchmarking of five state-of-the-art single-cell RNA sequencing integration techniques in 2,600 integration experiments indicates that sample imbalance has substantial impacts on downstream analyses and the biological interpretation of integration results. Imbalance perturbation led to statistically significant variation in unsupervised clustering, cell type classification, differential expression and marker gene annotation, query-to-reference mapping and trajectory inference. We quantified the impacts of imbalance through newly introduced properties-aggregate cell type support and minimum cell type center distance. To better characterize and mitigate impacts of imbalance, we introduce balanced clustering metrics and imbalanced integration guidelines for integration method users.},

abstract ={Epigenetic drift or "disorder" increases across the mouse lifespan and is suggested to underlie epigenetic clock signals. While the role of epigenetic drift in determining maximum lifespan across species has been debated, robust tests of this hypothesis are lacking. Here, we test if epigenetic disorder at various levels of genomic resolution explains maximum lifespan across four mammal species. We show that epigenetic disorder increases with age in all species and at all levels of genomic resolution tested. The rate of disorder accumulation occurs faster in shorter lived species and corresponds to species adjusted maximum lifespan. While the density of cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides ("CpGs") is negatively associated with the rate of age-associated disorder accumulation, it does not fully explain differences across species. Our findings support the hypothesis that the rate of epigenetic drift explains maximum lifespan and provide partial support for the hypothesis that CpG density buffers against epigenetic drift.},

title ={Cohesin mediated loop extrusion from active enhancers form chromatin jets in<i>C. elegans</i>},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.09.18.558239},
abstract ={In mammals, cohesin and CTCF organize the 3D genome into topologically associated domains (TADs) to regulate communication between cis-regulatory elements. However, many organisms, including S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and A. thaliana lack CTCF. Here, we use C. elegans as a model to investigate the function of cohesin in 3D genome organization in an animal without CTCF. We use auxin-inducible degradation to acutely deplete SMC-3 or its negative regulator WAPL-1 from somatic cells. Using Hi-C data, we identify a cohesin-dependent 3D genome organization feature called chromatin jets (aka fountains). These are population average reflections of DNA loops that are ~20-40 kb in scale and often cover a few transcribed genes. The jets emerge from NIPBL occupied segments, and the trajectory of the jets coincides with cohesin binding. Cohesin translocation from jet origins depends on a fully intact complex and is extended upon WAPL-1 depletion. Hi-C results support the idea that cohesin is preferentially loaded at NIPBL occupied sites and loop extrudes in an effectively two-sided manner. The location of putative loading sites coincide with active enhancers and the strength of chromatin jet pattern correlates with transcription. Hi-C analyses upon WAPL-1 depletion reveal unequal loop extrusion processivity on each side and stalling due to cohesin molecules colliding. Compared to mammalian systems, average processivity of C. elegans cohesin is ~10-fold shorter and NIPBL binding does not depend on cohesin. We conclude that the processivity of cohesin scales with genome size; and regardless of CTCF presence, preferential loading of cohesin at enhancers is a conserved mechanism of genome organization that regulates the interaction of gene regulatory elements in 3D.},

abstract ={Aging affects nearly all aspects of our cells, from our DNA to our proteins to how our cells handle stress and communicate with each other. Age-related chromatin changes are of particular interest because chromatin can dynamically respond to the cellular and organismal environment, and many modifications at chromatin are reversible. Changes at chromatin occur during aging, and evidence from model organisms suggests that chromatin factors could play a role in modulating the aging process itself, as altering proteins that work at chromatin often affect the lifespan of yeast, worms, flies, and mice. The field of chromatin and aging is rapidly expanding, and high-resolution genomics tools make it possible to survey the chromatin environment or track chromatin factors implicated in longevity with precision that was not previously possible. In this review, we discuss the state of chromatin and aging research. We include examples from yeast, Drosophila, mice, and humans, but we particularly focus on the commonly used aging model, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, in which there are many examples of chromatin factors that modulate longevity. We include evidence of both agerelated changes to chromatin and evidence of specific chromatin factors linked to longevity in core histones, nuclear architecture, chromatin remodeling, and histone modifications.},

abstract ={Information storage and retrieval is essential for all life. In biology, information is primarily stored in two distinct ways: the genome, comprising nucleic acids, acts as a foundational blueprint and the epigenome, consisting of chemical modifications to DNA and histone proteins, regulates gene expression patterns and endows cells with specific identities and functions. Unlike the stable, digital nature of genetic information, epigenetic information is stored in a digital-analog format, susceptible to alterations induced by diverse environmental signals and cellular damage. The Information Theory of Aging (ITOA) states that the aging process is driven by the progressive loss of youthful epigenetic information, the retrieval of which via epigenetic reprogramming can improve the function of damaged and aged tissues by catalyzing age reversal.},

abstract ={Stress preconditioning occurs when transient, sublethal stress events impact an organism's ability to counter future stresses. Although preconditioning effects are often noted in the literature, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms. To model preconditioning, we exposed a panel of genetically diverse Drosophila melanogaster to a sublethal heat shock and measured how well the flies survived subsequent exposure to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The impact of preconditioning varied with genetic background, ranging from dying half as fast to 4 and a half times faster with preconditioning compared to no preconditioning. Subsequent association and transcriptional analyses revealed that histone methylation, and transcriptional regulation are both candidate preconditioning modifier pathways. Strikingly, almost all subunits (7/8) in the Set1/COMPASS complex were identified as candidate modifiers of preconditioning. Functional analysis of Set1 knockdown flies demonstrated that loss of Set1 led to the transcriptional dysregulation of canonical ER stress genes during preconditioning. Based on these analyses, we propose a preconditioning model in which Set1 helps to establish an interim transcriptional "memory" of previous stress events, resulting in a preconditioned response to subsequent stress.},

abstract ={The gonad has become a central organ for understanding aging in C. elegans, as removing the proliferating stem cells in the germline results in significant lifespan extension. Similarly, when starvation in late larval stages leads to the quiescence of germline stem cells the adult nematode enters reproductive diapause, associated with an extended lifespan. This review summarizes recent advancements in identifying the mechanisms behind gonad-mediated lifespan extension, including comparisons with other nematodes and the role of lipid signaling and transcriptional changes. Given that the gonad also mediates lifespan regulation in other invertebrates and vertebrates, elucidating the underlying mechanisms may help to gain new insights into the mechanisms and evolution of aging.},

year ={2024},
doi ={10.1186/s13072-024-00547-5},
abstract ={Regenerative potential is governed by a complex process of transcriptional reprogramming, involving chromatin reorganization and dynamics in transcription factor binding patterns throughout the genome. The degree to which chromatin and epigenetic changes contribute to this process remains only partially understood. Here we provide a modified CUT&Tag protocol suitable for improved characterization and interrogation of changes in chromatin modifications during adult fin regeneration in zebrafish. Our protocol generates data that recapitulates results from previously published ChIP-Seq methods, requires far fewer cells as input, and significantly improves signal to noise ratios. We deliver high-resolution enrichment maps for H3K4me3 of uninjured and regenerating fin tissues. During regeneration, we find that H3K4me3 levels increase over gene promoters which become transcriptionally active and genes which lose H3K4me3 become silenced. Interestingly, these reprogramming events recapitulate the H3K4me3 patterns observed in developing fin folds of 24-h old zebrafish embryos. Our results indicate that changes in genomic H3K4me3 patterns during fin regeneration occur in a manner consistent with reactivation of developmental programs, demonstrating CUT&Tag to be an effective tool for profiling chromatin landscapes in regenerating tissues.},

doi ={10.1101/2023.12.06.570368},
abstract ={Metabolic and epigenetic rewiring are widely considered hallmarks of cancer, with emerging evidence of crosstalk between them. Anecdotal evidence of metabolic enzymes moonlighting in the chromatin environment has suggested how this crosstalk might be facilitated, but the extent of nuclear relocalization of metabolic enzymes remains elusive. Here, we provide a comprehensive chromatin proteomics resource across cancer lineages as well as healthy samples and demonstrate that metabolic enzyme moonlighting on chromatin is widespread across tissues and pathways. We show that the abundance of metabolic enzymes on chromatin is tissue-specific, with oxidative phosphorylation proteins depleted in lung cancer samples, perhaps suggesting an interplay between cell identity and nuclear metabolism. Finally, we explore metabolic functions in the chromatin environment and show that one-carbon folate enzymes are associated with DNA damage and repair processes, providing an approach to explore non-canonical functions of metabolic enzymes.},

title ={Inhibition of fatty acid oxidation enables heart regeneration in adult mice},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1038/s41586-023-06585-5},
abstract ={Postnatal maturation of cardiomyocytes is characterized by a metabolic switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation, chromatin reconfiguration and exit from the cell cycle, instating a barrier for adult heart regeneration 1,2. Here, to explore whether metabolic reprogramming can overcome this barrier and enable heart regeneration, we abrogate fatty acid oxidation in cardiomyocytes by inactivation of Cpt1b. We find that disablement of fatty acid oxidation in cardiomyocytes improves resistance to hypoxia and stimulates cardiomyocyte proliferation, allowing heart regeneration after ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Metabolic studies reveal profound changes in energy metabolism and accumulation of α-ketoglutarate in Cpt1b-mutant cardiomyocytes, leading to activation of the α-ketoglutarate-dependent lysine demethylase KDM5 (ref. 3). Activated KDM5 demethylates broad H3K4me3 domains in genes that drive cardiomyocyte maturation, lowering their transcription levels and shifting cardiomyocytes into a less mature state, thereby promoting proliferation. We conclude that metabolic maturation shapes the epigenetic landscape of cardiomyocytes, creating a roadblock for further cell divisions. Reversal of this process allows repair of damaged hearts.},

This extremely intriguing phenotype has been linked to alterations in mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism. The true biochemical function of the mitochondrial PHB complex remains elusive, but it has been shown to affect membrane lipid composition. Recent work, using large-scale biochemical approaches, has highlighted a broad effect of PHB on the C. elegans metabolic network. Collectively, the biochemical data support the notion that PHB modulates, at least partially, worm longevity through the moderation of fat utilisation and energy production via the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Herein, we review, in a systematic manner, recent biochemical insights into the impact of PHB on the C. elegans metabolome.},

title ={Role of METTL20 in regulating β-oxidation and heat production in mice under fasting or ketogenic conditions},
year ={2018},
doi ={10.1038/s41598-018-19615-4},
abstract ={METTL20 is a seven-β-strand methyltransferase that is localised to the mitochondria and tri-methylates the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) β subunit (ETFB) at lysines 200 and 203. It has been shown that METTL20 decreases the ability of ETF to extract electrons from medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase (MCAD) and glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase in vitro. METTL20-mediated methylation of ETFB influences the oxygen consumption rate in permeabilised mitochondria, suggesting that METTL20-mediated ETFB methylation may also play a regulatory role in mitochondrial metabolism. In this study, we generated Mettl20 knockout (KO) mice to uncover the in vivo functions of METTL20. The KO mice were viable, and a loss of ETFB methylation was confirmed. In vitro enzymatic assays revealed that mitochondrial ETF activity was higher in the KO mice than in wild-type mice, suggesting that the KO mice had higher β-oxidation capacity. Calorimetric analysis showed that the KO mice fed a ketogenic diet had higher oxygen consumption and heat production. A subsequent cold tolerance test conducted after 24 h of fasting indicated that the KO mice had a better ability to maintain their body temperature in cold environments. Thus, METTL20 regulates ETF activity and heat production through lysine methylation when β-oxidation is highly activated.},

abstract ={In this report, we discovered a new entity named cataract, alopecia, oral mucosal disorder, and psoriasis-like (CAOP) syndrome in two unrelated and ethnically diverse patients. Furthermore, patient 1 failed to respond to regular treatment. We found that CAOP syndrome was caused by an autosomal recessive defect in the mitochondrial membrane-bound transcription factor peptidase/site-1 protease (MBTPS1, S1P). Mitochondrial abnormalities were observed in patient 1 with CAOP syndrome. Furthermore, we found that S1P is a novel mitochondrial protein that forms a trimeric complex with ETFA/ETFB. S1P enhances ETFA/ETFB flavination and maintains its stability. Patient S1P variants destabilize ETFA/ETFB, impair mitochondrial respiration, decrease fatty acid b-oxidation activity, and shift mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis. Mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory lesions in patient 1 were significantly ameliorated by riboflavin supplementation, which restored the stability of ETFA/ETFB. Our study discovered that mutations in MBTPS1 resulted in a new entity of CAOP syndrome and elucidated the mechanism of the mutations in the new disease.},

title ={New protein–protein interactions of mitochondrial connexin 43 in mouse heart},
year ={2016},
doi ={10.1111/jcmm.12792},
abstract ={Connexin 43 (Cx43), the gap junction protein involved in cell-to-cell coupling in the heart, is also present in the subsarcolemmal fraction of cardiomyocyte mitochondria. It has been described to regulate mitochondrial potassium influx and respiration and to be important for ischaemic preconditioning protection, although the molecular effectors involved are not fully characterized. In this study, we looked for potential partners of mitochondrial Cx43 in an attempt to identify new molecular pathways for cardioprotection. Mass spectrometry analysis of native immunoprecipitated mitochondrial extracts showed that Cx43 interacts with several proteins related with mitochondrial function and metabolism. Among them, we selected for further analysis only those present in the subsarcolemmal mitochondrial fraction and known to be related with the respiratory chain. Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and the beta-subunit of the electron-transfer protein (ETFB), two proteins unrelated to date with Cx43, fulfilled these conditions, and their interaction with Cx43 was proven by direct and reverse co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, a previously unknown molecular interaction between AIF and ETFB was established, and protein content and sub-cellular localization appeared to be independent from the presence of Cx43. Our results identify new protein-protein interactions between AIF-Cx43, ETFB-Cx43 and AIF-ETFB as possible players in the regulation of the mitochondrial redox state.},

abstract ={Multiple Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (MADD) is a severe mitochondrial disorder featuring multi-organ dysfunction. Mutations in either the ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH genes can cause MADD but very little is known about disease specific mechanisms due to a paucity of animal models. We report a novel zebrafish mutant dark xavier (dxa vu463) that has an inactivating mutation in the etfa gene. dxa vu463 recapitulates numerous pathological and biochemical features seen in patients with MADD including brain, liver, and kidney disease. Similar to children with MADD, homozygote mutant dxa vu463 zebrafish have a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from moderate to severe. Interestingly, excessive maternal feeding significantly exacerbated the phenotype. Homozygous mutant dxa vu463 zebrafish have swollen and hyperplastic neural progenitor cells, hepatocytes and kidney tubule cells as well as elevations in triacylglycerol, cerebroside sulfate and cholesterol levels. Their mitochondria were also greatly enlarged, lacked normal cristae, and were dysfunctional. We also found increased signaling of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) with enlarged cell size and proliferation. Treatment with rapamycin partially reversed these abnormalities. Our results indicate that etfa gene function is remarkably conserved in zebrafish as compared to humans with highly similar pathological, biochemical abnormalities to those reported in children with MADD. Altered mTORC1 signaling and maternal nutritional status may play critical roles in MADD disease progression and suggest novel treatment approaches that may ameliorate disease severity.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1002/hep4.1691},
abstract ={The electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) complex, made up of the ETF alpha subunit (ETFA), ETF beta subunit (ETFB), and ETF dehydrogenase (ETFDH), regulates fatty acid β-oxidation activity while scavenging leaked electrons through flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)/reduced form FAD (FADH 2) redox reactions in mitochondria. Here, we hypothesized that ETF dysfunction-mediated FAD deficiency may result in increased mitochondrial oxidative stress and steatosis and subsequent liver injury. We report that etfa haploinsufficiency caused hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hepatic steatosis and injury in adult zebrafish. Further, etfa +/-mutant livers had reduced levels of FAD and glutathione and an increase in reactive oxygen species. Because FAD depletion might be critical in the pathogenesis of the liver lesion identified in etfa +/-mutants, we used riboflavin to elevate FAD levels in the liver and found that riboflavin supplementation significantly suppressed hepatic steatosis and injury in etfa +/-mutants through suppression of oxidative stress and de novo lipogenesis in the liver. Additionally, we found that adenosine triphosphate-linked mitochondrial oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential were reduced in etfa +/-primary hepatocytes and that riboflavin supplementation corrected these defects. Conclusion: FAD depletion caused by etfa haploinsufficiency plays a key role in hepatic steatosis and oxidative stress-mediated hepatic injury in adult zebrafish. This raises the possibility that people with ETFA haploinsufficiency have a high risk for developing liver disease. (Hepatology Communications 2021;5:976-991).},

abstract ={The protein methylome in mammalian mitochondria has been little studied until recently. Here, we describe that lysine-368 of human citrate synthase is methylated and that the modifying enzyme, localized in the mitochondrial matrix, is methyltransferase-like protein 12 (METTL12), a member of the family of 7b-strand methyltransferases. Lysine-368 is near the active site of citrate synthase, but removal of methylation has no effect on its activity. In mitochondria, it is possible that some or all of the enzymes of the citric acid cycle, including citrate synthase, are organized in metabolons to facilitate the channelling of substrates between participating enzymes. Thus, possible roles for the methylation of Lys-368 are in controlling substrate channelling itself, or in influencing protein-protein interactions in the metabolon.},

doi ={10.1016/j.gene.2021.145407},
abstract ={Electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) is an enzyme with orthologs from bacteria to humans. Human ETF is nuclear encoded by two separate genes, ETFA and ETFB, respectively. After translation, the two subunits are imported to the mitochondrial matrix space and assemble into a heterodimer containing one FAD and one AMP as cofactors. ETF functions as a hub taking up electrons from at least 14 flavoenzymes, feeding them into the respiratory chain. This represents a major source of reducing power for the electron transport chain from fatty acid oxidation and amino acid degradation. Transfer of electrons from the donor enzymes to ETF occurs by direct transfer between the enzyme bound flavins, a process that is tightly regulated by the polypeptide chain and by protein: protein interactions. ETF, in turn relays electrons to the iron sulfur cluster of the inner membrane protein ETF: QO, from where they travel via the FAD in ETF:QO to ubiquinone, entering the respiratory chain at the level of complex III. ETF recognizes its dehydrogenase partners via a recognition loop that anchors the protein on its partner followed by dynamic movements of the ETF flavin domain that bring redox cofactors in close proximity, thus promoting electron transfer. Genetic mutations in the ETFA or ETFB genes cause the Mendelian disorder multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD; OMIM #231680). We here review the knowledge on human ETF and investigations of the effects of disease-associated missense mutations in this protein that have promoted the understanding of the essential role that ETF plays in cellular metabolism and human disease.},

abstract ={In mammals, the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) is a heterodimeric protein composed of two subunits, a and b, that is responsible for the oxidation of at least nine mitochondrial matrix flavoprotein dehydrogenases. Electrons accepted by ETF are further transferred to the main respiratory chain via the ETF ubiquinone oxide reductase (ETFQO). Sequence analysis of the unique Arabidopsis homologues of two subunits of ETF revealed their high similarity to both subunits of the mammalian ETF. Yeast two-hybrid experiments showed that the Arabidopsis ETFa and ETFb can form a heteromeric protein. Isolation and characterization of two independent T-DNA insertional Arabidopsis mutants of the ETFb gene revealed accelerated senescence and early death compared to wild-type during extended darkness. Furthermore in contrast to wild-type, the etfb mutants demonstrated a significant accumulation of several amino acids, isovaleryl CoA and phytanoyl CoA during dark-induced carbohydrate deprivation. These phenotypic characteristics of etfb mutants are broadly similar to those that we observed previously in Arabidopsis etfqo mutants, suggesting functional association between ETF and ETFQO in Arabidopsis, and confirming the essential roles of the ETF/ETFQO electron transfer complex in the catabolism of leucine and involvement in the chlorophyll degradation pathway activated during darkinduced carbohydrate deprivation.},

year ={2014},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pone.0105394},
abstract ={Lysine methylation has been extensively studied in histones, where it has been shown to provide specific epigenetic marks for the regulation of gene expression; however, the molecular mechanism and physiological function of lysine methylation in proteins other than histones remains to be fully addressed. To better understand the substrate diversity of lysine methylation, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) derivatives with alkyne-moieties have been synthesized. A selenium-based SAM analog, propargylic Se-adenosyl-L-selenomethionine (ProSeAM), has a wide spectrum of reactivity against various lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) with sufficient stability to support enzymatic reactions in vitro. By using ProSeAM as a chemical probe for lysine methylation, we identified substrates for two seven-beta-strand KMTs, METTL21A and METTL10, on a proteomic scale in mammalian cells. METTL21A has been characterized as a heat shock protein (HSP)-70 methyltransferase. Mammalian METTL10 remains functionally uncharacterized, although its ortholog in yeast, See1, has been shown to methylate the translation elongation factor eEF1A. By using ProSeAM-mediated alkylation followed by purification and quantitative MS analysis, we confirmed that METTL21A labels HSP70 family proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrated that METTL10 also methylates the eukaryotic elongation factor EF1A1 in mammalian cells. Subsequent biochemical characterization revealed that METTL10 specifically trimethylates EF1A1 at lysine 318 and that siRNA-mediated knockdown of METTL10 decreases EF1A1 methylation levels in vivo. Thus, our study emphasizes the utility of the synthetic cofactor ProSeAM as a chemical probe for the identification of non-histone substrates of KMTs.},

abstract ={Mitochondrial dysfunction can either extend or decrease Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan, depending on whether transcriptionally regulated responses can elicit durable stress adaptation to otherwise detrimental lesions. Here, we test the hypothesis that enhanced metabolic flexibility is sufficient to circumvent bioenergetic abnormalities associated with the phenotypic threshold effect, thereby transforming short-lived mitochondrial mutants into long-lived ones. We find that CEST-2.2, a carboxylesterase mainly localizes in the intestine, may stimulate the survival of mitochondrial deficient animals. We report that genetic manipulation of cest-2.2 expression has a minor lifespan impact on wildtype nematodes, whereas its overexpression markedly extends the lifespan of complex I-deficient gas-1(fc21) mutants. We profile the transcriptome and lipidome of cest-2.2 overexpressing animals and show that CEST-2.2 stimulates lipid metabolism and fatty acid beta-oxidation, thereby enhancing mitochondrial respiratory capacity through complex II and LET-721/ETFDH, despite the inherited genetic lesion of complex I. Together, our findings unveil a metabolic pathway that, through the tissue-specific mobilization of lipid deposits, may influence the longevity of mitochondrial mutant C. elegans.},

abstract ={The relationship between lipid metabolism and longevity remains unclear. Although fat oxidation is essential for weight loss, whether it remains beneficial when sustained for long periods, and the extent to which it may attenuate or augment lifespan remain important unanswered questions. Here, we develop an experimental handle in the Caenorhabditis elegans model system, in which we uncover the mechanisms that connect long-term fat oxidation with longevity. We find that sustained b-oxidation via activation of the conserved triglyceride lipase ATGL-1, triggers a feedback transcriptional loop that involves the mito-nuclear transcription factor ATFS-1, and a previously unknown and highly conserved repressor of ATGL-1 called HLH-11/AP4. This feedback loop orchestrates the dual control of fat oxidation and lifespan, and shields the organism from lifeshortening mitochondrial stress in the face of continuous fat oxidation. Thus, we uncover one mechanism by which fat oxidation can be sustained for long periods without deleterious effects on longevity.},

title ={Histone methylation regulates reproductive diapause in Drosophila melanogaster},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1010906},
abstract ={Fluctuating environments threaten fertility and viability. To better match the immediate, local environment, many organisms adopt alternative phenotypic states, a phenomenon called "phenotypic plasticity." Natural populations that predictably encounter fluctuating environments tend to be more plastic than conspecific populations that encounter a constant environment, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity can be adaptive. Despite pervasive evidence of such "adaptive phenotypic plasticity," gene regulatory mechanisms underlying plasticity remains poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that environment-dependent phenotypic plasticity is mediated by epigenetic factors. To test this hypothesis, we exploit the adaptive reproductive arrest of Drosophila melanogaster females, called diapause. Using an inbred line from a natural population with high diapause plasticity, we demonstrate that diapause is determined epigenetically: only a subset of genetically identical individuals enter diapause and this diapause plasticity is epigenetically transmitted for at least three generations. Upon screening a suite of epigenetic marks, we discovered that the active histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K36me1 are depleted in diapausing ovaries. Using ovary-specific knockdown of histone mark writers and erasers, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 and H3K36me1 depletion promotes diapause. Given that diapause is highly polygenic, that is, distinct suites of alleles mediate diapause plasticity across distinct genotypes, we also investigated the potential for genetic variation in diapause-determining epigenetic marks. Specifically, we asked if these histone marks were similarly depleted in diapause of a genotypically distinct line. We found evidence of divergence in both the gene expression program and histone mark abundance. This study reveals chromatin determinants of phenotypic plasticity and suggests that these determinants may be genotype-dependent, offering new insight into how organisms may exploit and evolve epigenetic mechanisms to persist in fluctuating environments.},

abstract ={AU : Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly: Why and how we age are 2 intertwined questions that have fascinated scientists for many decades. However, attempts to answer these questions remain compartmentalized, preventing a comprehensive understanding of the aging process. We argue that the current lack of knowledge about the evolution of aging mechanisms is due to a lack of clarity regarding evolutionary theories of aging that explicitly involve physiological processes: the disposable soma theory (DST) and the developmental theory of aging (DTA). In this Essay, we propose a new hierarchical model linking genes to vital rates, enabling us to critically reevaluate the DST and DTA in terms of their relationship to evolutionary genetic theories of aging (mutation accumulation (MA) and antagonistic pleiotropy (AP)). We also demonstrate how these 2 theories can be incorporated in a unified hierarchical framework. The new framework will help to generate testable hypotheses of how the hallmarks of aging are shaped by natural selection.},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.1534/genetics.120.303565},
abstract ={Caenorhabditis elegans survives on ephemeral food sources in the wild, and the species has a variety of adaptive responses to starvation. These features of its life history make the worm a powerful model for studying developmental, behavioral, and metabolic starvation responses. Starvation resistance is fundamental to life in the wild, and it is relevant to aging and common diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Worms respond to acute starvation at different times in the life cycle by arresting development and altering gene expression and metabolism. They also anticipate starvation during early larval development, engaging an alternative developmental program resulting in dauer diapause. By arresting development, these responses postpone growth and reproduction until feeding resumes. A common set of signaling pathways mediates systemic regulation of development in each context but with important distinctions. Several aspects of behavior, including feeding, foraging, taxis, egg laying, sleep, and associative learning, are also affected by starvation. A variety of conserved signaling, gene regulatory, and metabolic mechanisms support adaptation to starvation. Early life starvation can have persistent effects on adults and their descendants. With its short generation time, C. elegans is an ideal model for studying maternal provisioning, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, and developmental origins of adult health and disease in humans. This review provides a comprehensive overview of starvation responses throughout the C. elegans life cycle.},

title ={Phospholipids undergo hop diffusion in compartmentalized cell membrane},
year ={2002},
doi ={10.1083/jcb.200202050},
abstract ={he diffusion rate of lipids in the cell membrane is reduced by a factor of 5-100 from that in artificial bilayers. This slowing mechanism has puzzled cell biologists for the last 25 yr. Here we address this issue by studying the movement of unsaturated phospholipids in rat kidney fibroblasts at the single molecule level at the temporal resolution of 25 s. The cell membrane was found to be compartmentalized: phospholipids are confined within 230-nm-diameter () compartments for 11 ms on average before hopping to adjacent compartments. These 230-nm compartments exist within greater 750-nm-compartments where these phospholipids are confined for 0.33 s on average. T The diffusion rate within 230-nm compartments is 5.4 m 2 /s, which is nearly as fast as that in large unilamellar vesicles, indicating that the diffusion in the cell membrane is reduced not because diffusion per se is slow, but because the cell membrane is compartmentalized with regard to lateral diffusion of phospholipids. Such compartmentalization depends on the actin-based membrane skeleton, but not on the extracellular matrix, extracellular domains of membrane proteins, or cholesterol-enriched rafts. We propose that various transmembrane proteins anchored to the actinbased membrane skeleton meshwork act as rows of pickets that temporarily confine phospholipids.},

abstract ={Nutrition and metabolism are known to influence chromatin biology and epigenetics through post-translational modifications, yet how this interaction influences genomic architecture and connects to gene expression is unknown. Here we consider, as a model, the metabolicallydriven dynamics of H3K4me3, a histone methylation mark that is known to encode information about active transcription, cell identity, and tumor suppression. We analyze the genome-wide changes in H3K4me3 and gene expression in response to alterations in methionine availability in both normal mouse physiology and human cancer cells. Surprisingly, we find that the location of H3K4me3 peaks is largely preserved under methionine restriction, while the response of H3K4me3 peak width encodes almost all aspects of H3K4me3 biology including changes in expression levels, and the presence of cell identity and cancer-associated genes. These findings may reveal general principles for how nutrient availability modulates specific aspects of chromatin dynamics to mediate biological function.},

title ={PQM-1 controls hypoxic survival via regulation of lipid metabolism},
year ={2020},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-020-18369-w},
abstract ={Animals have evolved responses to low oxygen conditions to ensure their survival. Here, we have identified the C. elegans zinc finger transcription factor PQM-1 as a regulator of the hypoxic stress response. PQM-1 is required for the longevity of insulin signaling mutants, but surprisingly, loss of PQM-1 increases survival under hypoxic conditions. PQM-1 functions as a metabolic regulator by controlling oxygen consumption rates, suppressing hypoxic glycogen levels, and inhibiting the expression of the sorbitol dehydrogenase-1 SODH-1, a crucial sugar metabolism enzyme. PQM-1 promotes hypoxic fat metabolism by maintaining the expression of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase FAT-7, an oxygen consuming, rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis. PQM-1 activity positively regulates fat transport to developing oocytes through vitellogenins under hypoxic conditions, thereby increasing survival rates of arrested progeny during hypoxia. Thus, while pqm-1 mutants increase survival of mothers, ultimately this loss is detrimental to progeny survival. Our data support a model in which PQM-1 controls a trade-off between lipid metabolic activity in the mother and her progeny to promote the survival of the species under hypoxic conditions.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-022-28469-4},
abstract ={As a major risk factor to human health, obesity presents a massive burden to people and society. Interestingly, the obese status of parents can cause progeny's lipid accumulation through epigenetic inheritance in multiple species. To date, many questions remain as to how lipid accumulation leads to signals that are transmitted across generations. In this study, we establish a nematode model of C. elegans raised on a high-fat diet (HFD) that leads to measurable lipid accumulation, which can transmit the lipid accumulation signal to their multigenerational progeny. Using this model, we find that transcription factors DAF-16/ FOXO and SBP-1/SREBP, nuclear receptors NHR-49 and NHR-80, and delta-9 desaturases (fat-5, fat-6, and fat-7) are required for transgenerational lipid accumulation. Additionally, histone H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks lipid metabolism genes and increases their transcription response to multigenerational obesogenic effects. In summary, this study establishes an interaction between a network of lipid metabolic genes and chromatin modifications, which work together to achieve transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of obesogenic effects.},

title ={<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> establishes germline versus soma by balancing inherited histone methylation},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1242/dev.196600},
abstract ={Formation of a zygote is coupled with extensive epigenetic reprogramming to enable appropriate inheritance of histone methylation and prevent developmental delays. In Caenorhabditis elegans, this reprogramming is mediated by the H3K4me2 demethylase SPR-5 and the H3K9 methyltransferase, MET-2. In contrast, the H3K36 methyltransferase MES-4 maintains H3K36me2/3 at germline genes between generations to facilitate re-establishment of the germline. To determine whether the MES-4 germline inheritance pathway antagonizes spr-5; met-2 reprogramming, we examined the interaction between these two pathways. We found that the developmental delay of spr-5; met-2 mutant progeny is associated with ectopic H3K36me3 and the ectopic expression of MES-4-targeted germline genes in somatic tissues. Furthermore, the developmental delay is dependent upon MES-4 and the H3K4 methyltransferase, SET-2. We propose that MES-4 prevents crucial germline genes from being repressed by antagonizing maternal spr-5; met-2 reprogramming. Thus, the balance of inherited histone modifications is necessary to distinguish germline versus soma and prevent developmental delay.

title ={Beyond Proteostasis: Lipid Metabolism as a New Player in ER Homeostasis},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.3390/metabo11010052},
abstract ={Biological membranes are not only essential barriers that separate cellular and subcellular structures, but also perform other critical functions such as the initiation and propagation of intraand intercellular signals. Each membrane-delineated organelle has a tightly regulated and custommade membrane lipid composition that is critical for its normal function. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) consists of a dynamic membrane network that is required for the synthesis and modification of proteins and lipids. The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen activates an adaptive stress response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR-ER). Interestingly, recent findings show that lipid perturbation is also a direct activator of the UPR-ER, independent of protein misfolding. Here, we review proteostasis-independent UPR-ER activation in the genetically tractable model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. We review the current knowledge on the membrane lipid composition of the ER, its impact on organelle function and UPR-ER activation, and its potential role in human metabolic diseases. Further, we summarize the bi-directional interplay between lipid metabolism and the UPR-ER. We discuss recent progress identifying the different respective mechanisms by which disturbed proteostasis and lipid bilayer stress activate the UPR-ER. Finally, we consider how genetic and metabolic disturbances may disrupt ER homeostasis and activate the UPR and discuss how using-omics-type analyses will lead to more comprehensive insights into these processes.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-021-22257-2},
abstract ={Histone acetylations are important epigenetic markers for transcriptional activation in response to metabolic changes and various stresses. Using the high-throughput SEquencing-Based Yeast replicative Lifespan screen method and the yeast knockout collection, we demonstrate that the HDA complex, a class-II histone deacetylase (HDAC), regulates aging through its target of acetylated H3K18 at storage carbohydrate genes. We find that, in addition to longer lifespan, disruption of HDA results in resistance to DNA damage and osmotic stresses. We show that these effects are due to increased promoter H3K18 acetylation and transcriptional activation in the trehalose metabolic pathway in the absence of HDA. Furthermore, we determine that the longevity effect of HDA is independent of the Cyc8-Tup1 repressor complex known to interact with HDA and coordinate transcriptional repression. Silencing the HDA homologs in C. elegans and Drosophila increases their lifespan and delays aging-associated physical declines in adult flies. Hence, we demonstrate that this HDAC controls an evolutionarily conserved longevity pathway.},

doi ={10.3389/fgene.2021.768996},
abstract ={Epigenetic modifications are responsible for finetuning gene expression profiles to the needs of cells, tissues, and organisms. To rapidly respond to environmental changes, the activity of chromatin modifiers critically depends on the concentration of a handful of metabolites that act as substrates and co-factors. In this way, these enzymes act as metabolic sensors that directly link gene expression to metabolic states. Although metabolites can easily diffuse through the nuclear pore, molecular mechanisms must be in place to regulate epigenetic marker deposition in specific nuclear subdomains or even on single loci. In this review, I explore the possible subcellular sites of metabolite production that influence the epigenome. From the relationship between cytoplasmic metabolism and nuclear metabolite deposition, I converse to the description of a compartmentalized nuclear metabolism. Last, I elaborate on the possibility of metabolic enzymes to operate in phase-separated nuclear microdomains formed by multienzyme and chromatin-bound protein complexes.},

abstract ={We have previously shown TANGO1 organises membranes at the interface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ERGIC/Golgi (Raote et al., 2018). TANGO1 corrals retrograde membranes at ER exit sites to create an export conduit. Here the retrograde membrane is, in itself, an anterograde carrier. This mode of forward transport necessitates a mechanism to prevent membrane mixing between ER and the retrograde membrane. TANGO1 has an unusual membrane helix organisation, composed of one membrane-spanning helix (TM) and another that penetrates the inner leaflet (IM). We have reconstituted these membrane helices in model membranes and shown that TM and IM together reduce the flow of lipids at a region of defined shape. We have also shown that the helices align TANGO1 around an ER exit site. We suggest this is a mechanism to prevent membrane mixing during TANGO1-mediated transfer of bulky secretory cargos from the ER to the ERGIC/Golgi via a tunnel.},

SUMOylation affects these two axes in the transcriptional program of UPR mt with distinct mechanisms: change of DVE-1 subcellular localization vs. change of ATFS-1 stability and activity.

year ={2020},
doi ={10.1101/2020.09.05.284521},
abstract ={Mammalian cells require activated folates to generate nucleotides for growth and division. The most abundant circulating folate species is 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-THF), which is used to synthesize methionine from homocysteine via the cobalamin-dependent enzyme methionine synthase (MTR). Cobalamin deficiency traps folates as 5-methyl-THF. Here, we show using isotope tracing that methionine synthase is only a minor source of methionine in cell culture, tissues, or xenografted tumors. Instead, methionine synthase is required for cells to avoid folate trapping and assimilate 5-methyl-THF into other folate species. Under conditions of physiological extracellular folates, genetic MTR knockout in tumor cells leads to folate trapping, purine synthesis stalling, nucleotide depletion, and impaired growth in cell culture and as xenografts. These defects are rescued by free folate but not one-carbon unit supplementation. Thus, MTR plays a crucial role in liberating tetrahydrofolate for use in one-carbon metabolism.},

doi ={10.1101/2023.03.09.531951},
abstract ={The declining capacity of cells to maintain a functional proteome is a major driver of cellular dysfunction and decreased fitness in aging. Here we assess the impact of aging on multiple proteome dimensions, which are reflective of function, across the replicative lifespan of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We quantified protein abundance, protein turnover, protein thermal stability, and protein phosphorylation in mother yeast cells and their derived progeny at different ages. We find progressive and cumulative proteomic alterations that are reflective of dysregulation of complex assemblies, mitochondrial remodeling, post-translational activation of the AMPK/Snf1 energy sensor in mother cells, and an overall shift from biosynthetic to energy-metabolic processes. Our multidimensional proteomic study systematically corroborates previous findings of asymmetric segregation and daughter cell rejuvenation, and extends these concepts to protein complexes, protein phosphorylation, and activation of signaling pathways. Lastly, profiling age-dependent proteome changes in a caloric restriction model of yeast provided mechanistic insights into longevity, revealing minimal remodeling of energy-metabolic pathways, improved mitochondrial maintenance, ameliorated protein biogenesis, and decreased stress responses. Taken together, our study provides thousands of age-dependent molecular events that can be used to gain a holistic understanding of mechanisms of aging.},

abstract ={Metabolites affect cell growth in two different ways. First, they serve as building blocks for biomass accumulation. Second, metabolites regulate the activity of growth-relevant signaling pathways. They do so in part by covalently attaching to proteins, thereby generating post-translational modifications (PTMs) that affect protein function, the focus of this Perspective. Recent advances in mass spectrometry have revealed a wide variety of such metabolites, including lipids, amino acids, Coenzyme-A, acetate, malonate, and lactate to name a few. An active area of research is to understand which modifications affect protein function and how they do so. In many cases, the cellular levels of these metabolites affect the stoichiometry of the corresponding PTMs, providing a direct link between cell metabolism and the control of cell signaling, transcription, and cell growth.},

abstract ={Ageing has been defined as a global decline in physiological function depending on both environmental and genetic factors. Here we identify gene transcripts that are similarly regulated during physiological ageing in nematodes, zebrafish and mice. We observe the strongest extension of lifespan when impairing expression of the branched-chain amino acid transferase-1 (bcat-1) gene in C. elegans, which leads to excessive levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). We further show that BCAAs reduce a LET-363/mTOR-dependent neuro-endocrine signal, which we identify as DAF-7/TGFb, and that impacts lifespan depending on its related receptors, DAF-1 and DAF-4, as well as ultimately on DAF-16/FoxO and HSF-1 in a cell-non-autonomous manner. The transcription factor HLH-15 controls and epistatically synergizes with BCAT-1 to modulate physiological ageing. Lastly and consistent with previous findings in rodents, nutritional supplementation of BCAAs extends nematodal lifespan. Taken together, BCAAs act as periphery-derived metabokines that induce a central neuro-endocrine response, culminating in extended healthspan.},

abstract ={Organism aging occurs at the multicellular level; however, how pro-longevity mechanisms slow down aging in different cell types remains unclear. We generated single-cell transcriptomic atlases across the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans under different prolongevity conditions (http://mengwanglab.org/atlas). We found cell-specific, age-related changes across somatic and germ cell types and developed transcriptomic aging clocks for different tissues. These clocks enabled us to determine tissue-specific aging-slowing effects of different pro-longevity mechanisms, and identify major cell types sensitive to these regulations. Additionally, we provided a systemic view of alternative polyadenylation events in different cell types, as well as their cell-type-specific changes during aging and under different pro-longevity conditions. Together, this study provides molecular insights into how aging occurs in different cell types and how they respond to pro-longevity strategies.

year ={2020},
doi ={10.1016/j.devcel.2020.06.011},
abstract ={Aging is associated with a loss of metabolic homeostasis and plasticity, which is causally linked to multiple ageonset pathologies. The majority of the interventions-genetic, dietary, and pharmacological-that have been found to slow aging and protect against age-related disease in various organisms do so by targeting central metabolic pathways. However, targeting metabolic pathways chronically and ubiquitously makes it difficult to define the downstream effects responsible for lifespan extension and often results in negative effects on growth and health, limiting therapeutic potential. Insight into how metabolic signals are relayed between tissues, cells, and organelles opens up new avenues to target metabolic regulators locally rather than globally for healthy aging. In this review, we discuss the pro-longevity effects of targeting metabolic pathways in specific tissues and how these interventions communicate with distal cells to modulate aging. These studies may be crucial in designing interventions that promote longevity without negative health consequences.},

abstract ={Hydrogen peroxide is the preeminent chemical weapon that organisms use for combat. Individual cells rely on conserved defenses to prevent and repair peroxide-induced damage, but whether similar defenses might be coordinated across cells in animals remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a neuronal circuit in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that processes information perceived by two sensory neurons to control the induction of hydrogen peroxide defenses in the organism. We found that catalases produced by Escherichia coli, the nematode's food source, can deplete hydrogen peroxide from the local environment and thereby protect the nematodes. In the presence of E. coli, the nematode's neurons signal via TGFb-insulin/ IGF1 relay to target tissues to repress expression of catalases and other hydrogen peroxide defenses. This adaptive strategy is the first example of a multicellular organism modulating its defenses when it expects to freeload from the protection provided by molecularly orthologous defenses from another species.},

abstract ={The mechanism behind transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is unclear, particularly through the maternal grandparental line. We previously showed that disruption of folate metabolism in mice by the Mtrr hypomorphic mutation results in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of congenital malformations. Either maternal grandparent can initiate this phenomenon, which persists for at least four wildtype generations. Here, we use genome-wide approaches to reveal genetic stability in the Mtrr model and genome-wide differential DNA methylation in the germline of Mtrr mutant maternal grandfathers. We observe that, while epigenetic reprogramming occurs, wildtype grandprogeny and great grandprogeny exhibit transcriptional changes that correlate with germline methylation defects. One region encompasses the Hira gene, which is misexpressed in embryos for at least three wildtype generations in a manner that distinguishes Hira transcript expression as a biomarker of maternal phenotypic inheritance.},

abstract ={Ageing is a complex process with common and distinct features across tissues. Unveiling the underlying processes driving ageing in individual tissues is indispensable to decipher the mechanisms of organismal longevity. Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established model organism that has spearheaded ageing research with the discovery of numerous genetic pathways controlling its lifespan. However, it remains challenging to dissect the ageing of worm tissues due to the limited description of tissue pathology and access to tissue-specific molecular changes during ageing. In this study, we isolated cells from five major tissues in young and old worms and profiled the age-induced transcriptomic changes within these tissues. We observed a striking diversity of ageing across tissues and identified different sets of longevity regulators therein. In addition, we found novel tissue-specific factors, including irx-1 and myrf-2, which control the integrity of the intestinal barrier and sarcomere structure during ageing respectively. This study demonstrates the complexity of ageing across worm tissues and highlights the power of tissue-specific transcriptomic profiling during ageing, which can serve as a resource to the field.},

doi ={10.1101/2020.06.12.149005},
abstract ={Targeting folate metabolism can be an effective way to treat cancer. The enzyme methionine synthase catalyzes a key reaction in both folate and methionine metabolism. Early work suggested that inhibiting methionine synthase might restrain tumor growth, though the mechanism remains unclear. We find that due to its specific role in processing folates, methionine synthase is required for cancer proliferation. However, widely used cell culture conditions obscure the proliferative and metabolic consequences of methionine synthase inhibition. Complete dependence on methionine synthase only arises when 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate, the major folate found in circulation, is the predominant folate source provided to cells. In these physiological folate conditions, methionine synthase activity is necessary to maintain intracellular levels of nucleotides, but not methionine. These data reveal that the extracellular environment can alter the essentiality of methionine synthase and suggest that this enzyme plays a crucial cell-autonomous role in supporting nucleotide synthesis and cell proliferation in physiological contexts.},

abstract ={Aging is the primary driver of various diseases, including common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Currently there is no cure for AD and PD, and the development of novel drug candidates is demanding. Spermidine is a small anti-aging molecule with elimination of damaged mitochondria via the process of mitophagy identified as a molecular mechanism of action. Here, we show that spermidine inhibits memory loss in AD worms and improves behavioral performance, e.g., locomotor capacity, in a PD worm model, both via the PINK1-PDR1-dependent mitophagy pathway. Additionally, spermidine delays accelerated aging and improves healthspan in the DNA repairdeficient premature aging Werner syndrome (WS) worm model. While possible intertwined interactions between mitophagy/autophagy induction and DNA repair by spermidine are to be determined, our data support further translation of spermidine as a possible therapeutic intervention for such diseases.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-022-28201-2},
abstract ={MATα1 catalyzes the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, the principal biological methyl donor. Lower MATα1 activity and mitochondrial dysfunction occur in alcohol-associated liver disease. Besides cytosol and nucleus, MATα1 also targets the mitochondria of hepatocytes to regulate their function. Here, we show that mitochondrial MATα1 is selectively depleted in alcohol-associated liver disease through a mechanism that involves the isomerase PIN1 and the kinase CK2. Alcohol activates CK2, which phosphorylates MATα1 at Ser114 facilitating interaction with PIN1, thereby inhibiting its mitochondrial localization. Blocking PIN1-MATα1 interaction increased mitochondrial MATα1 levels and protected against alcohol-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and fat accumulation. Normally, MATα1 interacts with mitochondrial proteins involved in TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid βoxidation. Preserving mitochondrial MATα1 content correlates with higher methylation and expression of mitochondrial proteins. Our study demonstrates a role of CK2 and PIN1 in reducing mitochondrial MATα1 content leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in alcoholassociated liver disease.},

title ={Glucose restriction drives spatial reorganization of mevalonate metabolism},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.62591},
abstract ={Eukaryotes compartmentalize metabolic pathways into sub-cellular domains, but the role of inter-organelle contacts in organizing metabolic reactions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that in response to acute glucose restriction (AGR) yeast undergo metabolic remodeling of their mevalonate pathway that is spatially coordinated at nucleus-vacuole junctions (NVJs). The NVJ serves as a metabolic platform by selectively retaining HMG-CoA Reductases (HMGCRs), driving mevalonate pathway flux in an Upc2-dependent manner. Both spatial retention of HMGCRs and increased mevalonate pathway flux during AGR is dependent on NVJ tether Nvj1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HMGCRs associate into high-molecular-weight assemblies during AGR in an Nvj1-dependent manner. Loss of Nvj1-mediated HMGCR partitioning can be bypassed by artificially multimerizing HMGCRs, indicating NVJ compartmentalization enhances mevalonate pathway flux by promoting the association of HMGCRs in high molecular weight assemblies. Loss of HMGCR compartmentalization perturbs yeast growth following glucose starvation, indicating it promotes adaptive metabolic remodeling. Collectively, we propose a noncanonical mechanism regulating mevalonate metabolism via the spatial compartmentalization of rate-limiting HMGCR enzymes at an inter-organelle contact site.},

abstract ={The metabolome represents a complex network of biological events that reflects the physiologic state of the organism in health and disease. Additionally, specific metabolites and metabolic signaling pathways have been shown to modulate animal ageing, but whether there are convergent mechanisms uniting these processes remains elusive. Here, we used high resolution mass spectrometry to obtain the metabolomic profiles of canonical longevity pathways in C. elegans to identify metabolites regulating life span. By leveraging the metabolomic profiles across pathways, we found that one carbon metabolism and the folate cycle are pervasively regulated in common. We observed similar changes in long-lived mouse models of reduced insulin/IGF signaling. Genetic manipulation of pathway enzymes and supplementation with one carbon metabolites in C. elegans reveal that regulation of the folate cycle represents a shared causal mechanism of longevity and proteoprotection. Such interventions impact the methionine cycle, and reveal methionine restriction as an underlying mechanism. This comparative approach reveals key metabolic nodes to enhance healthy ageing.},

doi ={10.1016/j.cstres.2024.04.003},
abstract ={Histone H3/H4 chaperone anti-silencing function 1 (ASF1) is a conserved factor mediating nucleosomal assembly and disassembly, playing crucial roles in processes such as replication, transcription, and DNA repair. Nevertheless, its involvement in aging has remained unclear. Here, we utilized the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to demonstrate that the loss of UNC-85, the homolog of ASF1, leads to a shortened lifespan in a multicellular organism. Furthermore, we show that UNC-85 is required for epigenome-mediated longevity, as knockdown of the histone H3 lysine K4 methyltransferase ash-2 does not extend the lifespan of unc-85 mutants. In this context, we found that the longevity-promoting ash-2 RNA interference enhances UNC-85 activity by increasing its nuclear localization. Finally, our data indicate that the loss of UNC-85 increases the activity of one-carbon metabolism, and that downregulation of the one-carbon metabolism component dao-3/MTHFD2 partially rescues the short lifespan of unc-85 mutants. Together, these findings reveal UNC-85/ASF1 as a modulator of the central metabolic pathway and a factor regulating a pro-longevity response, thus shedding light on a mechanism of how nucleosomal maintenance associates with aging.},

abstract ={Transient reprogramming by the expression of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC (OSKM) is a therapeutic strategy for tissue regeneration and rejuvenation, but little is known about its metabolic requirements. Here we show that OSKM reprogramming in mice causes a global depletion of vitamin B 12 and molecular hallmarks of methionine starvation. Supplementation with vitamin B 12 increases the efficiency of reprogramming both in mice and in cultured cells, the latter indicating a cell-intrinsic effect. We show that the epigenetic mark H3K36me3, which prevents illegitimate initiation of transcription outside promoters (cryptic transcription), is sensitive to vitamin B 12 levels, providing evidence for a link between B 12 levels, H3K36 methylation, transcriptional fidelity and efficient reprogramming. Vitamin B 12 supplementation also accelerates tissue repair in a model of ulcerative colitis. We conclude that vitamin B 12 , through its key role in one-carbon metabolism and epigenetic dynamics, improves the efficiency of in vivo reprogramming and tissue repair.},

doi ={10.3389/fragi.2022.860404},
abstract ={Organisms are constantly exposed to stress both from the external environment and internally within the cell. To maintain cellular homeostasis under different environmental and physiological conditions, cell have adapted various stress response signaling pathways, such as the heat shock response (HSR), unfolded protein responses of the mitochondria (UPR MT), and the unfolded protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPR ER). As cells grow older, all cellular stress responses have been shown to deteriorate, which is a major cause for the physiological consequences of aging and the development of numerous age-associated diseases. In contrast, elevated stress responses are often associated with lifespan extension and amelioration of degenerative diseases in different model organisms, including C. elegans. Activating cellular stress response pathways could be considered as an effective intervention to alleviate the burden of aging by restoring function of essential damage-clearing machinery, including the ubiquitin-proteosome system, chaperones, and autophagy. Here, we provide an overview of newly emerging concepts of these stress response pathways in healthy aging and longevity with a focus on the model organism, C. elegans.},

abstract ={S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a versatile metabolite that participates in a wide range of reactions such as methylation and transsulfuration. These capabilities allow SAM to influence cellular processes such as gene expression and redox balancing. The importance of SAM is highlighted by its widespread usage as an over-the-counter nutrient supplement and as an experimental reagent in molecular biology. The bioavailability and cellular transport properties of SAM, however, are often overlooked under these contexts, putting limits on SAM's therapeutic potential and complicating the interpretation of experimental results. In this article, we examined the chemical stability and cellular permeability of SAM, proposed a schematic for indirect SAM transport across the mammalian plasma membrane, and lastly discussed the implications arising from such transport schematic.},

Many of these diseases are influenced by age-associated metabolic dysregulation, but how metabolism changes in multiple organs during aging in males and females is not known. Answering this could reveal new mechanisms of aging and age-targeted therapeutics. In this study, we describe how metabolism changes in 12 organs in male and female mice at 5 different ages. Organs show distinct patterns of metabolic aging that are affected by sex differently. Hydroxyproline shows the most consistent change across the dataset, decreasing with age in 11 out of 12 organs investigated. We also developed a metabolic aging clock that predicts biological age and identified alpha-ketoglutarate, previously shown to extend lifespan in mice, as a key predictor of age. Our results reveal fundamental insights into the aging process and identify new therapeutic targets to maintain organ health.},

doi ={10.1038/s41586-023-05922-y},
abstract ={Physiological homeostasis becomes compromised during ageing, as a result of impairment of cellular processes, including transcription and RNA splicing 1-4. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the loss of transcriptional fidelity are so far elusive, as are ways of preventing it. Here we profiled and analysed genome-wide, ageing-related changes in transcriptional processes across different organisms: nematodes, fruitflies, mice, rats and humans. The average transcriptional elongation speed (RNA polymerase II speed) increased with age in all five species. Along with these changes in elongation speed, we observed changes in splicing, including a reduction of unspliced transcripts and the formation of more circular RNAs. Two lifespan-extending interventions, dietary restriction and lowered insulin-IGF signalling, both reversed most of these ageing-related changes. Genetic variants in RNA polymerase II that reduced its speed in worms 5 and flies 6 increased their lifespan. Similarly, reducing the speed of RNA polymerase II by overexpressing histone components, to counter age-associated changes in nucleosome positioning, also extended lifespan in flies and the division potential of human cells. Our findings uncover fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying animal ageing and lifespan-extending interventions, and point to possible preventive measures.},

The aims of the current study were to identify binding partners of MATα1 and elucidate how MATα1 regulates CYP2E1 expression. We identified binding partners of MATα1 by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and mass spectrometry. Interacting proteins were confirmed using co-IP using recombinant proteins, liver lysates and mitochondria. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) samples were used to confirm relevance of our findings.

abstract ={Heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1) is a master regulator of stress responses across taxa. Overexpression of HSF-1 or genetic ablation of its conserved negative regulator, heat shock factor binding protein 1 (HSB-1), results in robust lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we found that increased HSF-1 activity elevates histone H4 levels in somatic tissues during development, while knockdown of H4 completely suppresses HSF-1-mediated longevity. Moreover, overexpression of H4 is sufficient to extend life span. Ablation of HSB-1 induces an H4dependent increase in micrococcal nuclease protection of both nuclear chromatin and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which consequently results in reduced transcription of mtDNA-encoded complex IV genes, decreased respiratory capacity, and a mitochondrial unfolded protein response-dependent lifespan extension. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unknown role of HSB-1/HSF-1 signaling in modulation of mitochondrial function via mediating histone H4-dependent regulation of mtDNA gene expression and concomitantly acting as a determinant of organismal longevity.},

abstract ={Histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) is extensively regulated by numerous writer and eraser enzymes in mammals. Nine H3K4me enzymes are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders to date, indicating their important roles in the brain. However, interplay among H3K4me enzymes during brain development remains largely unknown. Here, we show functional interactions of a writer-eraser duo, KMT2A and KDM5C, which are responsible for Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome (WDSTS), and mental retardation X-linked syndromic Claes-Jensen type (MRXSCJ), respectively. Despite opposite enzymatic activities, the two mouse models deficient for either Kmt2a or Kdm5c shared reduced dendritic spines and increased aggression. Double mutation of Kmt2a and Kdm5c clearly reversed dendritic morphology, key behavioral traits including aggression, and partially corrected altered transcriptomes and H3K4me landscapes. Thus, our study uncovers common yet mutually suppressive aspects of the WDSTS and MRXSCJ models and provides a proof of principle for balancing a single writer-eraser pair to ameliorate their associated disorders.},

abstract ={Here we describe a single-cell atlas of aging for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This unique resource describes the expression across adulthood of over 20,000 genes among 211 groups of cells that correspond to virtually every cell type in this organism. Our findings suggest that C. elegans aging is not random and stochastic in nature, but rather characterized by coordinated changes in functionally related metabolic and stress-response genes in a highly cell-type specific fashion. Aging signatures of different cell types are largely different from one another, downregulation of energy metabolism being the only nearly universal change. Some biological pathways, such as genes associated with translation, DNA repair and the ER unfolded protein response, exhibited strong (in some cases opposite) changes in subsets of cell types, but many more were limited to a single cell type. Similarly, the rates at which cells aged, measured as genome-wide expression changes, differed between cell types; some of these differences were tested and validated in vivo by measuring age-dependent changes in mitochondrial morphology. In some, but not all, cell types, aging was characterized by an increase in cell-to-cell variance. Finally, we identified a set of transcription factors whose activities changed coordinately across many cell types with age. This set was strongly enriched for stress-resistance TFs known to influence the rate of aging. We tested other members of this set, and discovered that some, such as GEI-3, likely also regulate the rate of aging. Our dataset can be accessed and queried at c.elegans.aging.atlas.research.calicolabs.com/.},

abstract ={Genetic, environmental and pharmacological interventions into the aging process can confer resistance to a multiple age-related diseases in laboratory animals, including rhesus monkeys. These findings imply that mechanisms of aging might contribute to patterns of multimorbidity in humans, and hence could be targeted to prevent multiple conditions simultaneously. To address this question, we text mined 917,645 literature abstracts followed by manual curation, and found strong, nonrandom associations between age-related diseases and aging mechanisms, confirmed by gene set enrichment analysis of GWAS data. Integration of these associations with clinical data from 3.01 million patients showed that age-related diseases associated with each of five aging mechanisms were more likely than chance to be present together in patients. Genetic evidence revealed that innate and adaptive immunity, the intrinsic apoptotic signalling pathway and activity of the ERK1/2 pathway played a significant role across multiple aging mechanisms and multiple, diverse age-related diseases. Mechanisms of aging therefore contribute to multiple age-related diseases and to patterns of human age-related multimorbidity, and could potentially be targeted to prevent more than one age-related condition in the same patient.},

abstract ={itochondria not only contribute to the harvesting of energy, but also serve as key signaling hubs connecting numerous metabolic processes to essential cellular and organismal functions 1-3. It is therefore not surprising that the dysfunction of mitochondria is tightly associated with aging, as well as diverse human age-related diseases, including those affecting metabolic, cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems, as well as cancer 2,4-7. Moreover, mitochondria function as platforms to regulate programmed cell death and innate immune responses 1,8,9. Multiple mitochondrial stress response (MSR) pathways have evolved to adapt mitochondrial function to the ever-changing cellular milieu and to a variety of extracellular cues 10,11. However, aberrant activation of these MSR pathways may also be maladaptive and contribute to disease and aging 2 , underscoring the importance of the tight control of these regulatory circuits. The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR mt), one of these MSR pathways, is triggered by mitochondrial-to-nuclear communication, leading to an adaptive transcriptional response that promotes repair and recovery of the cell or organism from transient mitochondrial dysfunction 10-13. It recently emerged that activation of the UPR mt provides resistance to pathogen infections (for example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in Caenorhabditis elegans, and animals that failed to activate UPR mt during P. aeruginosa infection died earlier, suggesting that the UPR mt is a bona fide component of the innate immune response 14,15. In mammalian cells, mitochondrial perturbations also lead to cellular stress responses closely associated with innate immunity 9,16 ; for example, herpesvirus infections induce a mitochondrial DNA stress response, which enhances antiviral signaling and type I interferon responses and thereby confers viral resistance 17 .},

To explore the possibility that C. elegans exhibits reproductive death, we have compared sibling species pairs of the genera Caenorhabditis and Pristionchus with hermaphrodites and females. We report that yolk venting and constitutive, early pathology involving major anatomical changes occur only in hermaphrodites, which are also shorter lived. Moreover, only in hermaphrodites does germline removal suppress senescent pathology and markedly increase lifespan. This is consistent with the hypothesis that C. elegans exhibit reproductive death that is suppressed by germline ablation. If correct, this would imply a major difference in the ageing process between C. elegans and most higher organisms, and potentially explain the exceptional plasticity in C. elegans ageing. 1234567890():,; 1234567890():,;},

ExM of C. elegans is challenged by its cuticle, which is stiff and impermeable to antibodies. Here we present a strategy, expansion of C. elegans (ExCel), to expand fixed, intact C. elegans. ExCel enables simultaneous readout of fluorescent proteins, RNA, DNA location, and anatomical structures at resolutions of ~65-75 nm (3.3-3.8x linear expansion). We also developed epitope-preserving ExCel, which enables imaging of endogenous proteins stained by antibodies, and iterative ExCel, which enables imaging of fluorescent proteins after 20x linear expansion. We demonstrate the utility of the ExCel toolbox for mapping synaptic proteins, for identifying previously unreported proteins at cell junctions, and for gene expression analysis in multiple individual neurons of the same animal.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1080/15548627.2022.2068267},
abstract ={Dietary restriction (DR) is known to promote autophagy to exert its longevity effect. While SAMS-1 (S-adenosyl methionine synthetase-1) has been shown to be a key mediator of the DR response, little is known about the roles of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and SAM-dependent methyltransferase in autophagy and DR-induced longevity. In this study, we show that DR and SAMS-1 repress the activity of SET-2, a histone H3K4 methyltransferase, by limiting the availability of SAM. Consequently, the reduced H3K4me3 levels promote the expression and activity of two transcription factors, HLH-30/ TFEB and PHA-4/FOXA, which both regulate the transcription of autophagy-related genes. We then find that HLH-30/TFEB and PHA-4/FOXA act collaboratively on their common target genes to mediate the transcriptional response of autophagy-related genes and consequently the lifespan of the animals. Our study thus shows that the SAMS-1-SET-2 axis serves as a nutrient-sensing module to epigenetically coordinate the activation of HLH-30/TFEB and PHA-4/FOXA transcription factors to control macroautophagy/autophagy and longevity in response to DR.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1038/s41392-022-01211-8},
abstract ={Aging is accompanied by the decline of organismal functions and a series of prominent hallmarks, including genetic and epigenetic alterations. These aging-associated epigenetic changes include DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) regulation, and RNA modification, all of which participate in the regulation of the aging process, and hence contribute to aging-related diseases. Therefore, understanding the epigenetic mechanisms in aging will provide new avenues to develop strategies to delay aging. Indeed, aging interventions based on manipulating epigenetic mechanisms have led to the alleviation of aging or the extension of the lifespan in animal models. Small molecule-based therapies and reprogramming strategies that enable epigenetic rejuvenation have been developed for ameliorating or reversing aging-related conditions. In addition, adopting health-promoting activities, such as caloric restriction, exercise, and calibrating circadian rhythm, has been demonstrated to delay aging. Furthermore, various clinical trials for aging intervention are ongoing, providing more evidence of the safety and efficacy of these therapies. Here, we review recent work on the epigenetic regulation of aging and outline the advances in intervention strategies for aging and age-associated diseases. A better understanding of the critical roles of epigenetics in the aging process will lead to more clinical advances in the prevention of human aging and therapy of aging-related diseases.},

abstract ={Induction of the one-carbon cycle is an early hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer metabolism. Vital intermediary steps are localized to mitochondria, but it remains unclear how one-carbon availability connects to mitochondrial function. Here, we show that the one-carbon metabolite and methyl group donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is pivotal for energy metabolism. A gradual decline in mitochondrial SAM (mitoSAM) causes hierarchical defects in fly and mouse, comprising loss of mitoSAM-dependent metabolites and impaired assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Complex I stability and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis are directly controlled by mitoSAM levels, while other protein targets are predominantly methylated outside of the organelle before import. The mitoSAM pool follows its cytosolic production, establishing mitochondria as responsive receivers of onecarbon units. Thus, we demonstrate that cellular methylation potential is required for energy metabolism, with direct relevance for pathophysiology, aging, and cancer.},

year ={2018},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.35037.001},
abstract ={How multicellular organisms respond to and are impacted by severe hypothermic stress is largely unknown. From C. elegans screens for mutants abnormally responding to coldwarming stimuli, we identify a molecular genetic pathway comprising ISY-1, a conserved uncharacterized protein, and ZIP-10, a bZIP-type transcription factor. ISY-1 gatekeeps the ZIP-10 transcriptional program by regulating the microRNA mir-60. Downstream of ISY-1 and mir-60, zip-10 levels rapidly and specifically increase upon transient cold-warming exposure. Prolonged zip-10 up-regulation induces several protease-encoding genes and promotes stress-induced organismic death, or phenoptosis, of C. elegans. zip-10 deficiency confers enhanced resistance to prolonged cold-warming stress, more prominently in adults than larvae. We conclude that the ZIP-10 genetic program mediates cold-warming response and may have evolved to promote wild-population kin selection under resource-limiting and thermal stress conditions.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-022-28272-1},
abstract ={Sustained mitochondrial fitness relies on coordinated biogenesis and clearance. Both processes are regulated by constant targeting of proteins into the organelle. Thus, mitochondrial protein import sets the pace for mitochondrial abundance and function. However, our understanding of mitochondrial protein translocation as a regulator of longevity remains enigmatic. Here, we targeted the main protein import translocases and assessed their contribution to mitochondrial abundance and organismal physiology. We find that reduction in cellular mitochondrial load through mitochondrial protein import system suppression, referred to as MitoMISS, elicits a distinct longevity paradigm. We show that MitoMISS triggers the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, orchestrating an adaptive reprogramming of metabolism. Glycolysis and de novo serine biosynthesis are causatively linked to longevity, whilst mitochondrial chaperone induction is dispensable for lifespan extension. Our findings extent the pro-longevity role of UPR mt and provide insight, relevant to the metabolic alterations that promote or undermine survival and longevity.},

title ={Nuclear metabolism and the regulation of the epigenome},
year ={2020},
doi ={10.1038/s42255-020-00285-4},
abstract ={ellular metabolism supports every biological activity within the cell. Metabolic pathways are responsible for the conversion of extracellular nutrients such as glucose, fatty acids, amino acids and vitamins into a wide range of intracellular metabolites. These basic biochemical components can then be combined into complex macromolecules (anabolism) or broken down for the generation of energy and reducing power (catabolism) 1. Because metabolic pathways are highly intersectional, metabolic conversions must be compartmentalized in subcellular locations. Metabolic compartmentalization can be obtained through the formation of local enzyme complexes; temporal separation of reactions; or controlled influx and efflux of metabolites into isolated organelles, such as the mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and peroxisomes 2. However, given the inability of the nuclear pores to prevent the passage of metabolites, the nucleus has long been considered to be in metabolic homeostasis with the cytoplasm 3. Nevertheless, the establishment of the so-called epigenetic code through the chemical modification of chromatin is dependent on the same core metabolites that form the basis of cellular metabolism. Because chromatin modifications are crucial to the maintenance of cellular identity and function, mechanisms regulating nuclear metabolite pools are expected to exist. In this Review, we provide a framework to understand the interaction of cellular and nuclear metabolism, with an emphasis on the nodal metabolites that regulate central carbon metabolism and the epigenome. We give an overview of mechanisms that shield the epigenetic regulation of gene expression from fluctuations in cytoplasmic metabolite levels and discuss the controlled exchange in metabolites between the nuclear and non-nuclear compartments. Finally, we propose that disruption of the nuclear metabolite pools may underlie disease.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1009432},
abstract ={Epigenetic alterations occur as organisms age, and lead to chromatin deterioration, loss of transcriptional silencing and genomic instability. Dysregulation of the epigenome has been associated with increased susceptibility to age-related disorders. In this study, we aimed to characterize the age-dependent changes of the epigenome and, in turn, to understand epigenetic processes that drive aging phenotypes. We focused on the aging-associated changes in the repressive histone marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in C. elegans. We observed region-specific gain and loss of both histone marks, but the changes are more evident for H3K9me3. We further found alteration of heterochromatic boundaries in aged somatic tissues. Interestingly, we discovered that the most statistically significant changes reflected H3K9me3-marked regions that are formed during aging, and are absent in developing worms, which we termed "aging-specific repressive regions" (ASRRs). These ASRRs preferentially occur in genic regions that are marked by high levels of H3K9me2 and H3K36me2 in larval stages. Maintenance of high H3K9me2 levels in these regions have been shown to correlate with a longer lifespan. Next, we examined whether the changes in repressive histone marks lead to de-silencing of repetitive DNA elements, as reported for several other organisms. We observed increased expression of active repetitive DNA elements but not global re-activation of silent repeats in old worms, likely due to the distributed nature of repetitive elements in the C. elegans genome. Intriguingly, CELE45, a putative short interspersed nuclear element (SINE), was greatly overexpressed at old age and upon heat stress. SINEs have been suggested to regulate transcription in response to various cellular stresses in mammals. It is likely that CELE45 RNAs also play roles in stress response and aging in C. elegans. Taken together, our study revealed significant and specific agedependent changes in repressive histone modifications and repetitive elements, providing important insights into aging biology.},

doi ={10.15252/embr.202255548},
abstract ={Mechanisms underlying the depletion of NAD + and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aging and age-related disorders remain poorly defined. We show that reverse electron transfer (RET) at mitochondrial complex I, which causes increased ROS production and NAD + to NADH conversion and thus lowered NAD + / NADH ratio, is active during aging. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of RET decreases ROS production and increases NAD + / NADH ratio, extending the lifespan of normal flies. The lifespanextending effect of RET inhibition is dependent on NAD +dependent Sirtuin, highlighting the importance of NAD + /NADH rebalance, and on longevity-associated Foxo and autophagy pathways. RET and RET-induced ROS and NAD + /NADH ratio changes are prominent in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model and fly models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of RET prevents the accumulation of faulty translation products resulting from inadequate ribosomemediated quality control, rescues relevant disease phenotypes, and extends the lifespan of Drosophila and mouse AD models. Deregulated RET is therefore a conserved feature of aging, and inhibition of RET may open new therapeutic opportunities in the context of aging and age-related diseases including AD.},

title ={Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation regulates mitochondrial dynamics in brown adipocytes},

abstract ={The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) engages mitochondria at specialized ER domains known as mitochondriaassociated membranes (MAMs). Here, we used three-dimensional high-resolution imaging to investigate the formation of pleomorphic "megamitochondria" with altered MAMs in brown adipocytes lacking the Sel1L-Hrd1 protein complex of ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Mice with ERAD deficiency in brown adipocytes were cold sensitive and exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction. ERAD deficiency affected ER-mitochondria contacts and mitochondrial dynamics, at least in part, by regulating the turnover of the MAM protein, sigma receptor 1 (SigmaR1). Thus, our study provides molecular insights into ER-mitochondrial cross-talk and expands our understanding of the physiological importance of Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD.},

title ={Compartmentalised acyl-CoA metabolism and roles in chromatin regulation},
year ={2020},
doi ={10.1016/j.molmet.2020.01.005},
abstract ={Background: Many metabolites serve as important signalling molecules to adjust cellular activities and functions based on nutrient availability. Links between acetyl-CoA metabolism, histone lysine acetylation, and gene expression have been documented and studied over the past decade. In recent years, several additional acyl modifications to histone lysine residues have been identified, which depend on acyl-coenzyme A thioesters (acyl-CoAs) as acyl donors. Acyl-CoAs are intermediates of multiple distinct metabolic pathways, and substantial evidence has emerged that histone acylation is metabolically sensitive. Nevertheless, the metabolic sources of acyl-CoAs used for chromatin modification in most cases remain poorly understood. Elucidating how these diverse chemical modifications are coupled to and regulated by cellular metabolism is important in deciphering their functional significance. Scope of review: In this article, we review the metabolic pathways that produce acyl-CoAs, as well as emerging evidence for functional roles of diverse acyl-CoAs in chromatin regulation. Because acetyl-CoA has been extensively reviewed elsewhere, we will focus on four other acyl-CoA metabolites integral to major metabolic pathways that are also known to modify histones: succinyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, crotonoyl-CoA, and butyryl-CoA. We also briefly mention several other acyl-CoA species, which present opportunities for further research; malonyl-CoA, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA, and lactyl-CoA. Each acyl-CoA species has distinct roles in metabolism, indicating the potential to report shifts in the metabolic status of the cell. For each metabolite, we consider the metabolic pathways in which it participates and the nutrient sources from which it is derived, the compartmentalisation of its metabolism, and the factors reported to influence its abundance and potential nuclear availability. We also highlight reported biological functions of these metabolically-linked acylation marks. Finally, we aim to illuminate key questions in acyl-CoA metabolism as they relate to the control of chromatin modification. Major conclusions: A majority of acyl-CoA species are annotated to mitochondrial metabolic processes. Since acyl-CoAs are not known to be directly transported across mitochondrial membranes, they must be synthesized outside of mitochondria and potentially within the nucleus to participate in chromatin regulation. Thus, subcellular metabolic compartmentalisation likely plays a key role in the regulation of histone acylation. Metabolite tracing in combination with targeting of relevant enzymes and transporters will help to map the metabolic pathways that connect acyl-CoA metabolism to chromatin modification. The specific function of each acyl-CoA may be determined in part by biochemical properties that affect its propensity for enzymatic versus non-enzymatic protein modification, as well as the various enzymes that can add, remove and bind each modification. Further, competitive and inhibitory effects of different acyl-CoA species on these enzymes make determining the relative abundance of acyl-CoA species in specific contexts important to understand the regulation of chromatin acylation. An improved and more nuanced understanding of metabolic regulation of chromatin and its roles in physiological and disease-related processes will emerge as these questions are answered.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1016/j.abb.2021.108921},
abstract ={The Golgi complex is the membrane-bound organelle that lies at the center of the secretory pathway. Its main functions are to maintain cellular lipid homeostasis, to orchestrate protein processing and maturation, and to mediate protein sorting and export. These functions are not independent of one another, and they all require that the membranes of the Golgi complex have a well-defined biochemical composition. Importantly, a finelyregulated spatiotemporal organization of the Golgi membrane components is essential for the correct performance of the organelle. In here, we review our current mechanistic and molecular understanding of how Golgi membranes are spatially organized in the lateral and axial directions to fulfill their functions. In particular, we highlight the current evidence and proposed models of intra-Golgi transport, as well as the known mechanisms for the retention of Golgi residents and for the sorting and export of transmembrane cargo proteins. Despite the controversies, conflicting evidence, clashes between models, and technical limitations, the field has moved forward and we have gained extensive knowledge in this fascinating topic. However, there are still many important questions that remain to be completely answered. We hope that this review will help boost future investigations on these issues.},

title ={Relationship Between Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain Dysfunction, Development, and Life Extension in Caenorhabditis elegans},
year ={2007},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pbio.0050259},
abstract ={Prior studies have shown that disruption of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) function in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can result in life extension. Counter to these findings, many mutations that disrupt ETC function in humans are known to be pathologically life-shortening. In this study, we have undertaken the first formal investigation of the role of partial mitochondrial ETC inhibition and its contribution to the life-extension phenotype of C. elegans. We have developed a novel RNA interference (RNAi) dilution strategy to incrementally reduce the expression level of five genes encoding mitochondrial proteins in C. elegans: atp-3, nuo-2, isp-1, cco-1, and frataxin (frh-1). We observed that each RNAi treatment led to marked alterations in multiple ETC components. Using this dilution technique, we observed a consistent, three-phase lifespan response to increasingly greater inhibition by RNAi: at low levels of inhibition, there was no response, then as inhibition increased, lifespan responded by monotonically lengthening. Finally, at the highest levels of RNAi inhibition, lifespan began to shorten. Indirect measurements of whole-animal oxidative stress showed no correlation with life extension. Instead, larval development, fertility, and adult size all became coordinately affected at the same point at which lifespan began to increase. We show that a specific signal, initiated during the L3/L4 larval stage of development, is sufficient for initiating mitochondrial dysfunction-dependent life extension in C. elegans. This stage of development is characterized by the last somatic cell divisions normally undertaken by C. elegans and also by massive mitochondrial DNA expansion. The coordinate effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on several cell cycle-dependent phenotypes, coupled with recent findings directly linking cell cycle progression with mitochondrial activity in C. elegans, lead us to propose that cell cycle checkpoint control plays a key role in specifying longevity of mitochondrial mutants.},

abstract ={Vitamin B micronutrients are essential regulators of one carbon metabolism that ensures human health. Vitamin B9, or folate, lies at the heart of the folate cycle and converges with the methionine cycle to complete the one carbon pathway. Additionally, vitamin B6 contributes by orchestrating the flux of one carbon cycling. Dysregulation of vitamin B contributes to altered biochemical signaling that manifests in a spectrum of human diseases. This review presents an analysis of the past, present, and future work, highlighting the interplay between folate and vitamin B6 in one carbon metabolism. Emerging insights include advances in metabolomic-based mass spectrometry and the use of live-cell metabolic labeling. Cancer is used as a focal point to dissect vitamin crosstalk and highlight new insights into the roles of folate and vitamin B6 in metabolic control. This collection of vitamin-based research detailing the trends of one carbon metabolism in human disease exemplifies how the future of personalized medicine could unfold using this new base of knowledge and ultimately provide next-generation therapeutics.},

year ={},
doi ={10.1101/2021.04.25.441352},
abstract ={In value-based decision making, options are selected according to subjective values assigned by the individual to available goods and actions. Despite the importance of this faculty of the mind, the neural mechanisms of value assignments, and how choices are directed by them, remain obscure. To investigate this problem, we used a classic measure of utility maximization, the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference, to quantify internal consistency of food preferences in Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm with a nervous system of only 302 neurons. Using a novel combination of microfluidics and electrophysiology, we found that C. elegans food choices fulfill the necessary and sufficient conditions for utility maximization, indicating that nematodes behave exactly as if they maintain, and attempt to maximize, an underlying representation of subjective value. Food choices are well-fit by a utility function widely used to model human consumers. Moreover, as in many other animals, subjective values in C. elegans are learned, a process we now find requires intact dopamine signaling. Differential responses of identified chemosensory neurons to foods with distinct growth potential are amplified by prior consumption of these foods, suggesting that these neurons may be part of a value-assignment system. The demonstration of utility maximization in an organism with a nervous system of only 302 neurons sets a new lower bound on the computational requirements for its execution, and offers the prospect of an essentially complete explanation of value-based decision making at single neuron resolution.},

While individual m 5 C-methyltransferases have been studied, the impact of the global cytosine-5 methylome on development, homeostasis and stress remains unknown. Here, using Caenorhabditis elegans, we generated the first organism devoid of m 5 C in RNA, demonstrating that this modification is non-essential. We determined the localisation and enzymatic specificity of m 5 C sites in RNA in vivo and showed that animals devoid of m 5 C are sensitive to temperature stress. At the molecular level, we showed that loss of m 5 C specifically impacts decoding of leucine and proline thus reducing the translation efficiency of transcripts enriched in these amino acids. Finally, we found translation of leucine UUG codons to be the most strongly affected upon heat shock, suggesting a role of m 5 C tRNA wobble methylation in the adaptation to heat stress.},

doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1009342},
abstract ={Although most organisms synthesize methionine from homocysteine and methyl folates, some have "core" methionine synthases that lack folate-binding domains and use other methyl donors. In vitro, the characterized core synthases use methylcobalamin as a methyl donor, but in vivo, they probably rely on corrinoid (vitamin B12-binding) proteins. We identified four families of core methionine synthases that are distantly related to each other (under 30% pairwise amino acid identity). From the characterized enzymes, we identified the families MesA, which is found in methanogens, and MesB, which is found in anaerobic bacteria and archaea with the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. A third uncharacterized family, MesC, is found in anaerobic archaea that have the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and lack known forms of methionine synthase. We predict that most members of the MesB and MesC families accept methyl groups from the iron-sulfur corrinoid protein of that pathway. The fourth family, MesD, is found only in aerobic bacteria. Using transposon mutants and complementation, we show that MesD does not require 5-methyltetrahydrofolate or cobalamin. Instead, MesD requires an uncharacterized protein family (DUF1852) and oxygen for activity.},

abstract ={With the goal of representing common denominators of aging in different organisms López-Otín et al. in 2013 described nine hallmarks of aging. Since then, this representation has become a major reference point for the biogerontology field. The template for the hallmarks of aging account originated from landmark papers by Hanahan and Weinberg (2000, 2011) defining first six and later ten hallmarks of cancer. Here we assess the strengths and weaknesses of the hallmarks of aging account. As a checklist of diverse major foci of current aging research, it has provided a useful shared overview for biogerontology during a time of transition in the field. It also seems useful in applied biogerontology, to identify interventions (e.g. drugs) that impact multiple symptomatic features of aging. However, while the hallmarks of cancer provide a paradigmatic account of the causes of cancer with profound explanatory power, the hallmarks of aging do not. A worry is that as a non-paradigm the hallmarks of aging have obscured the urgent need to define a genuine paradigm, one that can provide a useful basis for understanding the mechanistic causes of the diverse aging pathologies. We argue that biogerontology must look and move beyond the hallmarks to understand the process of aging. In its normal state, then, a scientific community is an immensely efficient instrument for solving the problems or puzzles that its paradigms define. (Kuhn 1962) p. 166.},

doi ={10.1101/2020.09.13.295451},
abstract ={Intestinal microbiota play an essential role in the health of a host organism. Here, we define how commensal Escherichia coli (E. coli) alters its host after long term exposure to glucose using a C. elegans-E. coli system. Our data reveal that bacterial processing of glucose, rather than direct ingestion by the animal, results in reduced lifespan and healthspan, including reduced locomotion, oxidative stress resistance, and heat stress resistance in C. elegans. Chronic exposure of E. coli to glucose produces growth defects and increased advanced glycation end products within the E. coli. These negative effects are abrogated when the E. coli is not able to process the additional glucose and by the addition of the anti-glycation compound carnosine. Physiological changes of the host C. elegans are accompanied by dysregulation of detoxifying genes including glyoxalase, glutathione-Stransferase, and superoxide dismutase. Loss of gst-4 shortens C. elegans lifespan and blunts the animal's response to a glucose-fed bacteria diet. Taken together, we reveal that added dietary sugar may alter intestinal microbial E. coli to decrease lifespan and healthspan of the host and define the critical role of detoxification genes in maintaining health during a chronic high-sugar diet.},

abstract ={Ageing is a complex process with common and distinct features across tissues. Unveiling the underlying processes driving ageing in individual tissues is indispensable to decipher the mechanisms of organismal longevity. Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established model organism that has spearheaded ageing research with the discovery of numerous genetic pathways controlling its lifespan. However, it remains challenging to dissect the ageing of worm tissues due to the limited description of tissue pathology and access to tissue-specific molecular changes during ageing. In this study, we isolated cells from five major tissues in young and old worms and profiled the age-induced transcriptomic changes within these tissues. We observed a striking diversity of ageing across tissues and identified different sets of longevity regulators therein. In addition, we found novel tissue-specific factors, including irx-1 and myrf-2, which control the integrity of the intestinal barrier and sarcomere structure during ageing respectively. This study demonstrates the complexity of ageing across worm tissues and highlights the power of tissue-specific transcriptomic profiling during ageing, which can serve as a resource to the field.},

doi ={10.1101/2020.02.20.958579},
abstract ={Despite increasingly detailed knowledge of gene expression patterns, the regulatory architectures that drive them are not well understood. To address this, we compared transcriptional and regulatory element activities across five adult tissues of C. elegans , covering ~90% of cells, and defined regulatory grammars associated with ubiquitous, germline and somatic tissue-specific gene expression patterns. We find architectural features that distinguish two major promoter types. Germline-specific and ubiquitously-active promoters have well positioned +1 and-1 nucleosomes associated with a periodic 10-bp WW signal. Somatic tissue-specific promoters lack these features, have wider nucleosome depleted regions, and are more enriched for core promoter elements, which surprisingly differ between tissues. A 10-bp periodic WW signal is also associated with +1 nucleosomes of ubiquitous promoters in fly and zebrafish but is not detected in mouse and human. Our results demonstrate fundamental differences in regulatory architectures of germline-active and somatic tissue-specific genes and provide a key resource for future studies.},

title ={Phosphatidylcholine Affects Inner Membrane Protein Translocases of Mitochondria},
year ={2016},
doi ={10.1074/jbc.M116.722694},
abstract ={Two protein translocases transport precursor proteins into or across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The presequence translocase (TIM23 complex) sorts precursor proteins with a cleavable presequence either into the matrix or into the inner membrane. The carrier translocase (TIM22 complex) inserts multispanning proteins into the inner membrane. Both protein import pathways depend on the presence of a membrane potential, which is generated by the activity of the respiratory chain. The non-bilayer-forming phospholipids cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine are required for the activity of the respiratory chain and therefore to maintain the membrane potential for protein import. Depletion of cardiolipin further affects the stability of the TIM23 complex. The role of bilayer-forming phospholipids like phosphatidylcholine (PC) in protein transport into the inner membrane and the matrix is unknown. Here, we report that import of presequence-containing precursors and carrier proteins is impaired in PC-deficient mitochondria. Surprisingly, depletion of PC does not affect stability and activity of respiratory supercomplexes, and the membrane potential is maintained. Instead, the dynamic TIM23 complex is destabilized when the PC levels are reduced, whereas the TIM22 complex remains intact. Our analysis further revealed that initial precursor binding to the TIM23 complex is impaired in PC-deficient mitochondria. We conclude that reduced PC levels differentially affect the TIM22 and TIM23 complexes in mitochondrial protein transport.},

title ={UPR ER promotes lipophagy independent of chaperones to extend life span},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={Longevity is dictated by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. One of the key mechanisms to regulate lifespan extension is the induction of protein chaperones for protein homeostasis. Ectopic activation of the unfolded protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPR ER) specifically in neurons is sufficient to enhance organismal stress resistance and extend life span. Here, we find that this activation not only promotes chaperones but also facilitates ER restructuring and ER function. This restructuring is concomitant with lipid depletion through lipophagy. Activation of lipophagy is distinct from chaperone induction and is required for the lifespan extension found in this paradigm. Last, we find that overexpression of the lipophagy component, ehbp-1, is sufficient to deplete lipids, remodel ER, and promote life span. Therefore, UPR induction in neurons triggers two distinct programs in the periphery: the proteostasis arm through protein chaperones and metabolic changes through lipid depletion mediated by EH domain binding protein 1 (EHBP-1).},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.02.09.527915},
abstract ={Reproductive aging is one of the earliest human aging phenotypes, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to oocyte quality decline. However, it is not known which mitochondrial metabolic processes are critical for oocyte quality maintenance with age. To understand how mitochondrial processes contribute to C. elegans oocyte quality, we characterized the mitochondrial proteomes of young and aged wild-type and long-reproductive daf-2 mutants. Here we show that the mitochondrial proteomic profiles of young wild-type and daf-2 worms are similar and share upregulation of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism pathway enzymes. Reduction of the BCAA catabolism enzyme BCAT-1 shortens reproduction, elevates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels, and shifts mitochondrial localization. Moreover, bcat-1 knockdown decreases oocyte quality in daf-2 worms and reduces reproductive capability, indicating the role of this pathway in the maintenance of oocyte quality with age. Importantly, oocyte quality deterioration can be delayed, and reproduction can be extended in wild-type animals both by bcat-1 overexpression and by supplementing with Vitamin B1, a cofactor needed for BCAA metabolism.},

title ={CRTC-1 balances histone trimethylation and acetylation to promote longevity},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.1101/2022.08.31.506037},
abstract ={Loss of function during ageing is accompanied by transcriptional drift, altering gene expression and contributing to a variety of age-related diseases. CREB regulated transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs) have emerged as key regulators of gene expression that might be targeted to promote longevity. Here, we define the role of the Caenorhabditis elegans CRTC-1 in the epigenetic regulation of longevity. Endogenous CRTC-1 binds chromatin factors, including components of the COMPASS complex, which trimethylates lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3). CRISPR editing of endogenous CRTC-1 reveals that the CREBbinding domain in neurons is specifically required for H3K4me3-dependent longevity. However, this effect is independent of CREB but instead acts via the transcription factor AP-1. Strikingly, CRTC-1 also mediates global histone acetylation levels, and this acetylation is essential for H3K4me3-dependent longevity. Indeed, overexpression of an acetyltransferase enzyme is sufficient to promote longevity in wild-type worms. CRTCs, therefore, link energetics to longevity by critically fine-tuning histone acetylation and methylation to promote healthy ageing.},

abstract ={Tryptophan metabolism through the kynurenine pathway influences molecular processes critical to healthy aging including immune signaling, redox homeostasis, and energy production. Aberrant kynurenine metabolism occurs during normal aging and is implicated in many age-associated pathologies including chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, and cancer. We and others previously identified three kynurenine pathway genestdo-2, kynu-1, and acsd-1-for which decreasing expression extends lifespan in invertebrates. Here we report that knockdown of haao-1, a fourth gene encoding the enzyme 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA) dioxygenase (HAAO), extends lifespan by ~30% and delays age-associated health decline in Caenorhabditis elegans. Lifespan extension is mediated by increased physiological levels of the HAAO substrate 3HAA. 3HAA increases oxidative stress resistance and activates the Nrf2/SKN-1 oxidative stress response. In pilot studies, female Haao knockout mice or aging wild type male mice fed 3HAA supplemented diet were also long-lived. HAAO and 3HAA represent potential therapeutic targets for aging and age-associated disease.},

doi ={10.1101/2024.01.06.574476},
abstract ={How cell replication ultimately results in aging and the Hayflick limit are not fully understood. Here we show that clock-like accumulation of DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) throughout cell replication drives conserved aging mechanisms. G4 stimulates transcription-replication interactions to delay genome replication and impairs DNA re-methylation and histone modification recovery, leading to loss of heterochromatin. This creates a more permissive local environment for G4 formation in subsequent generations. As a result, G4s gradually accumulate on promoters throughout mitosis, driving clock-like DNA hypomethylation and chromatin opening. In patients and in vitro models, loss-of-function mutations in the G4-resolving enzymes WRN, BLM and ERCC8 accelerate the erosion of the epigenomic landscape around G4. G4-driven epigenomic aging is strongly correlated with biological age and is conserved in yeast, nematodes, insects, fish, rodents, and humans. Our results revealed a universal molecular mechanism of aging and provided mechanistic insight into how G-quadruplex processor mutations drive premature aging.},

doi ={10.1074/jbc.RA119.010032},
abstract ={Edited by Joel M. Gottesfeld The SIN3 histone-modifying complex regulates the expression of multiple methionine catabolic genes, including SAM synthetase (Sam-S), as well as SAM levels. To further dissect the relationship between methionine catabolism and epigenetic regulation by SIN3, we sought to identify genes and metabolic pathways controlled by SIN3 and SAM synthetase (SAM-S) in Drosophila melanogaster. Using several approaches, including RNAi-mediated gene silencing, RNA-Seq-and quantitative RT-PCR-based transcriptomics, and ultra-high-performance LC-MS/MS-and GC/MS-based metabolomics, we found that, as a global transcriptional regulator, SIN3 impacted a wide range of genes and pathways. In contrast, SAM-S affected only a narrow range of genes and pathways. The expression and levels of additional genes and metabolites, however, were altered in Sin3A؉Sam-S dual knockdown cells. This analysis revealed that SIN3 and SAM-S regulate overlapping pathways, many of which involve one-carbon and central carbon metabolisms. In some cases, the factors acted independently; in some others, redundantly; and for a third set, in opposition. Together, these results, obtained from experiments with the chromatin regulator SIN3 and the metabolic enzyme SAM-S, uncover a complex relationship between metabolism and epigenetic regulation.},

abstract ={We herein introduce voyAGEr, an online graphical interface to explore age-related gene expression alterations in 49 human tissues. voyAGEr offers a visualisation and statistical toolkit for the finding and functional exploration of sex-and tissue-specific transcriptomic changes with age. In its conception, we developed a novel bioinformatics pipeline leveraging RNA sequencing data, from the GTEx project, encompassing more than 900 individuals. voyAGEr reveals transcriptomic signatures of the known asynchronous ageing between tissues, allowing the observation of tissue-specific age-periods of major transcriptional changes, associated with alterations in different biological pathways, cellular composition, and disease conditions. Notably, voyAGEr was created to assist researchers with no expertise in bioinformatics, providing a supportive framework for elaborating, testing and refining their hypotheses on the molecular nature of human ageing and its association with pathologies, thereby also aiding in the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. voyAGEr is freely available at https:// compbio.imm.medicina.ulisboa.pt/app/voyAGEr. eLife assessment This work presents an important online platform designed to facilitate the exploration of genes and genetic pathways implicated in human aging. Leveraging a new inference methodology, the tool enables the identification and visualization of key genes and tissues impacted by aging, facilitating scientific discovery. The methods and analyses are convincing and will be broadly used by scientists aiming to mine human aging RNA-seq data.},

year ={2024},
doi ={10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae116},
abstract ={One-carbon metabolism is a complex network of metabolic reactions that are essential for cellular function including DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 and folate are micronutrients that are utilized in this pathway and their deficiency can result in the perturbation of onecarbon metabolism and subsequent perturbations in DNA replication and repair. This effect has been well characterized in nuclear DNA but to date, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has not been investigated extensively. Mitochondrial variants have been associated with several inherited and age-related disease states; therefore, the study of factors that impact heteroplasmy are important for advancing our understanding of the mitochondrial genome's impact on human health. Heteroplasmy studies require robust and efficient mitochondrial DNA enrichment to carry out in-depth mtDNA sequencing. Many of the current methods for mtDNA enrichment can introduce biases and false-positive results. Here, we use a method that overcomes these limitations and have applied it to assess mitochondrial heteroplasmy in mouse models of altered one-carbon metabolism. Vitamin B12 deficiency was found to cause increased levels of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy across all tissues that were investigated. Folic acid supplementation also contributed to elevated mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy across all mouse tissues investigated. Heteroplasmy analysis of human data from the Framingham Heart Study suggested a potential sex-specific effect of folate and vitamin B12 status on mitochondrial heteroplasmy. This is a novel relationship that may have broader consequences for our understanding of one-carbon metabolism, mitochondrial-related disease and the influence of nutrients on DNA mutation rates.},

abstract ={Olfactory and metabolic dysfunctions are intertwined phenomena associated with obesity and neurodegenerative diseases; yet how mechanistically olfaction regulates metabolic homeostasis remains unclear. Specificity of olfactory perception integrates diverse environmental odors and olfactory neurons expressing different receptors. Here, we report that specific but not all olfactory neurons actively regulate fat metabolism without affecting eating behaviors in Caenorhabditis elegans, and identified specific odors that reduce fat mobilization via inhibiting these neurons. Optogenetic activation or inhibition of the responsible olfactory neural circuit promotes the loss or gain of fat storage, respectively. Furthermore, we discovered that FLP-1 neuropeptide released from this olfactory neural circuit signals through peripheral NPR-4/neuropeptide receptor, SGK-1/serum-and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase, and specific isoforms of DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor to regulate fat storage. Our work reveals molecular mechanisms underlying olfactory regulation of fat metabolism, and suggests the association between olfactory perception specificity of each individual and his/her susceptibility to the development of obesity.},

abstract ={Cell-cell interactions are crucial for multicellular organisms as they shape cellular function and ultimately organismal phenotype. However, the spatial code embedded in the molecular interactions that drive and sustain spatial organization, and in the organization that in turns drives intercellular interactions across a living animal remains to be elucidated. Here we use the expression of ligand-receptor pairs obtained from a whole-body single-cell transcriptome of Caenorhabditis elegans larvae to compute the potential for intercellular interactions through a Bray-Curtis-like metric. Leveraging a 3D atlas of C. elegans' cells, we implement a genetic algorithm to select the ligand-receptor pairs most informative of the spatial organization of cells. Validating the strategy, the selected ligand-receptor pairs are involved in known cell-migration and morphogenesis processes and we confirm a negative correlation between cell-cell distances and interactions. Thus, our computational framework helps identify cell-cell interactions and their relationship with intercellular distances, and decipher molecular bases encoding spatial information in a whole animal. Furthermore, it can also be used to elucidate associations with any other intercellular phenotype and applied to other multicellular organisms.},

abstract ={AU : Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly: Why and how we age are 2 intertwined questions that have fascinated scientists for many decades. However, attempts to answer these questions remain compartmentalized, preventing a comprehensive understanding of the aging process. We argue that the current lack of knowledge about the evolution of aging mechanisms is due to a lack of clarity regarding evolutionary theories of aging that explicitly involve physiological processes: the disposable soma theory (DST) and the developmental theory of aging (DTA). In this Essay, we propose a new hierarchical model linking genes to vital rates, enabling us to critically reevaluate the DST and DTA in terms of their relationship to evolutionary genetic theories of aging (mutation accumulation (MA) and antagonistic pleiotropy (AP)). We also demonstrate how these 2 theories can be incorporated in a unified hierarchical framework. The new framework will help to generate testable hypotheses of how the hallmarks of aging are shaped by natural selection.},

abstract ={In a recent review article published in Cell, López-Otín and colleagues conducted an exhaustive literature review and described 12 hallmarks of aging. The updated model of aging comprehensively captures the key characteristics of the aging phenotype and incorporates new pathways that play a crucial role in age-related processes. Although the updated hallmarks of aging provide a useful framework for describing the phenotype of aging, aging itself is a result of mechanistically complex and interrelated processes that happen during the lifespan of the organism. Here, I propose to shift the focus from a systematic description and categorization of the hallmarks of aging to a model that separates early, molecular origins of changes from cellular and tissue responses and represents a sequential and causative character of changes in aging. The proposed model aims to prompt discussion among the aging research community, guide future efforts in the field, and provide new ideas for investigation.},

abstract ={The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits rapid senescence that is promoted by the insulin/IGF-1 signalling (IIS) pathway via regulated processes that are poorly understood. IIS also promotes production of yolk for egg provisioning, which in post-reproductive animals continues in an apparently futile fashion, supported by destructive repurposing of intestinal biomass that contributes to senescence. Here we show that post-reproductive mothers vent yolk which can be consumed by larvae and promotes their growth. This implies that later yolk production is not futile; instead vented yolk functions similarly to milk. Moreover, yolk venting is promoted by IIS. These findings suggest that a self-destructive, lactation-like process effects resource transfer from postreproductive C. elegans mothers to offspring, in a fashion reminiscent of semelparous organisms that reproduce in a single, suicidal burst. That this process is promoted by IIS provides insights into how and why IIS shortens lifespan in C. elegans.},

We used metabolomics and in situ three-dimensional submicrometer chemical imaging of single cells by gas cluster ion beam secondary ion mass spectrometry (GCIB-SIMS) to directly visualize de novo purine biosynthesis by a multienzyme complex, the purinosome. We found that purinosomes comprise nine enzymes that act synergistically, channeling the pathway intermediates to synthesize purine nucleotides, increasing the pathway flux, and influencing the adenosine monophosphate/guanosine monophosphate ratio. Our work also highlights the application of high-resolution GCIB-SIMS for multiplexed biomolecular analysis at the level of single cells.},

abstract ={Infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria is an emerging life-threatening issue worldwide. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157: H7 (EHEC) causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome via contaminated food. Treatment of EHEC infection with antibiotics is contraindicated because of the risk of worsening the syndrome through the secreted toxins. Identifying the host factors involved in bacterial infection provides information about how to combat this pathogen. In our previous study, we showed that EHEC colonizes in the intestine of Caenorhabditis elegans. However, the host factors involved in EHEC colonization remain elusive. Thus, in this study, we aimed to identify the host factors involved in EHEC colonization. We conducted forward genetic screens to isolate mutants that enhanced EHEC colonization and named this phenotype enhanced intestinal colonization (Inc). Intriguingly, four mutants with the Inc phenotype showed significantly increased EHEC-resistant survival, which contrasts with our current knowledge. Genetic mapping and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed that these mutants have loss-of-function mutations in unc-89. Furthermore, we showed that the tolerance of unc-89(wf132) to EHEC relied on HLH-30/TFEB activation. These findings suggest that hlh-30 plays a key role in pathogen tolerance in C. elegans.},

Insights included the recognition that obesity underlies major chronic diseases, that appetite is hormonally controlled, that hepatic steatosis is not a benign finding, and that diabetes might fundamentally be a disorder of lipid metabolism.

doi ={10.1093/genetics/iyad081},
abstract ={Heterochromatin is characterized by an enrichment of repetitive elements and low gene density and is often maintained in a repressed state across cell division and differentiation. The silencing is mainly regulated by repressive histone marks such as H3K9 and H3K27 methylated forms and the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family. Here, we analyzed in a tissue-specific manner the binding profile of the two HP1 homologs in Caenorhabditis elegans, HPL-1 and HPL-2, at the L4 developmental stage. We identified the genomewide binding profile of intestinal and hypodermal HPL-2 and intestinal HPL-1 and compared them with heterochromatin marks and other features. HPL-2 associated preferentially to the distal arms of autosomes and correlated positively with the methylated forms of H3K9 and H3K27. HPL-1 was also enriched in regions containing H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 but exhibited a more even distribution between autosome arms and centers. HPL-2 showed a differential tissue-specific enrichment for repetitive elements conversely with HPL-1, which exhibited a poor association. Finally, we found a significant intersection of genomic regions bound by the BLMP-1/PRDM1 transcription factor and intestinal HPL-1, suggesting a corepressive role during cell differentiation. Our study uncovers both shared and singular properties of conserved HP1 proteins, providing information about genomic binding preferences in relation to their role as heterochromatic markers.},

title ={Histone methyltransferase activity affects metabolism in human cells independently of transcriptional regulation},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pbio.3002354},
abstract ={AU : Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly: The N-terminal tails of eukaryotic histones are frequently posttranslationally modified. The role of these modifications in transcriptional regulation is well-documented. However, the extent to which the enzymatic processes of histone posttranslational modification might affect metabolic regulation is less clear. Here, we investigated how histone methylation might affect metabolism using metabolomics, proteomics, and RNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, primary tumour samples and healthy tissue samples. In cancer, the expression of histone methyltransferases (HMTs) was inversely correlated to the activity of NNMT, an enzyme previously characterised as a methyl sink that disposes of excess methyl groups carried by the universal methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM or AdoMet). In healthy tissues, histone methylation was inversely correlated to the levels of an alternative methyl sink, PEMT. These associations affected the levels of multiple histone marks on chromatin genome-wide but had no detectable impact on transcriptional regulation. We show that HMTs with a variety of different associations to transcription are co-regulated by the Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor in human cells. Rb-mutant cancers show increased total HMT activity and down-regulation of NNMT. Together, our results suggest that the total activity of HMTs affects SAM metabolism, independent of transcriptional regulation.},

doi ={10.15252/msb.202211002},
abstract ={Regulation of gene expression is linked to the organization of the genome. With age, chromatin alterations occur on all levels of genome organization, accompanied by changes in the gene expression profile. However, little is known about the changes in the level of transcriptional regulation. Here, we used a multi-omics approach and integrated ATAC-, RNA-and NET-seq to identify age-related changes in the chromatin landscape of murine liver and to investigate how these are linked to transcriptional regulation. We provide the first systematic inventory of the connection between aging, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptional regulation in a whole tissue. Aging in murine liver is characterized by an increase in chromatin accessibility at promoter regions, but not in an increase in transcriptional output. Instead, aging is accompanied by a decrease in promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), while initiation of transcription is not decreased as assessed by RNA polymerase mapping using CUT&RUN. Based on the data reported, we propose that these age-related changes in transcriptional regulation are due to a reduced stability of the pausing complex.},

title ={Polyunsaturated fatty acids and p38-MAPK link metabolic reprogramming to cytoprotective gene expression during dietary restriction},
year ={2020},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-020-18690-4},
abstract ={The metabolic state of an organism instructs gene expression modalities, leading to changes in complex life history traits, such as longevity. Dietary restriction (DR), which positively affects health and life span across species, leads to metabolic reprogramming that enhances utilisation of fatty acids for energy generation. One direct consequence of this metabolic shift is the upregulation of cytoprotective (CyTP) genes categorized in the Gene Ontology (GO) term of "Xenobiotic Detoxification Program" (XDP). How an organism senses metabolic changes during nutritional stress to alter gene expression programs is less known. Here, using a genetic model of DR, we show that the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially linoleic acid (LA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), are increased following DR and these PUFAs are able to activate the CyTP genes. This activation of CyTP genes is mediated by the conserved p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) pathway. Consequently, genes of the PUFA biosynthesis and p38-MAPK pathway are required for multiple paradigms of DR-mediated longevity, suggesting conservation of mechanism. Thus, our study shows that PUFAs and p38-MAPK pathway function downstream of DR to help communicate the metabolic state of an organism to regulate expression of CyTP genes, ensuring extended life span.},

abstract ={Identifying proteins that function at replication forks is essential to understanding DNA replication, chromatin assembly, and replication-coupled DNA repair mechanisms. Combining quantitative mass spectrometry in multiple cell types with stringent statistical cutoffs, we generated a high-confidence catalog of 593 proteins that are enriched at replication forks and nascent chromatin. Loss-of-function genetic analyses indicate that 85% yield phenotypes that are consistent with activities in DNA and chromatin replication or already have described functions in these processes. We illustrate the value of this resource by identifying activities of the BET family proteins BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 in controlling DNA replication. These proteins use their extraterminal domains to bind and inhibit the ATAD5 complex and thereby control the amount of PCNA on chromatin.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-022-28749-z},
abstract ={Altered methionine metabolism is associated with weight gain in obesity. The methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), catalyzing the first reaction of the methionine cycle, plays an important role regulating lipid metabolism. However, its role in obesity, when a plethora of metabolic diseases occurs, is still unknown. By using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) and genetic depletion of Mat1a, here, we demonstrate that Mat1a deficiency in diet-induce obese or genetically obese mice prevented and reversed obesity and obesity-associated insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis by increasing energy expenditure in a hepatocyte FGF21 dependent fashion. The increased NRF2-mediated FGF21 secretion induced by targeting Mat1a, mobilized plasma lipids towards the BAT to be catabolized, induced thermogenesis and reduced body weight, inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis. The beneficial effects of Mat1a ASO were abolished following FGF21 depletion in hepatocytes. Thus, targeting Mat1a activates the liver-BAT axis by increasing NRF2mediated FGF21 secretion, which prevents obesity, insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis.},

abstract ={As cells age, they undergo a remarkable global change: In transcriptional drift, hundreds of genes become overexpressed while hundreds of others become underexpressed. Using archetype modeling and Gene Ontology analysis on data from aging Caenorhabditis elegans worms, we find that the upregulated genes code for sensory proteins upstream of stress responses and downregulated genes are growth-and metabolism-related. We propose a simple mechanistic model for how such global coordination of multi-protein expression levels may be achieved by the binding of a single ligand that concentrates with age. A key implication is that a cell's own responses are part of its aging process, so unlike for wear-and-tear processes, intervention might be able to modulate these effects.},

title ={Nuclear lipid droplets and nuclear damage in Caenorhabditis elegans},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1009602},
abstract ={Fat stored in the form of lipid droplets has long been considered a defining characteristic of cytoplasm. However, recent studies have shown that nuclear lipid droplets occur in multiple cells and tissues, including in human patients with fatty liver disease. The function(s) of stored fat in the nucleus has not been determined, and it is possible that nuclear fat is beneficial in some situations. Conversely, nuclear lipid droplets might instead be deleterious by disrupting nuclear organization or triggering aggregation of hydrophobic proteins. We show here that nuclear lipid droplets occur normally in C. elegans intestinal cells and germ cells, but appear to be associated with damage only in the intestine. Lipid droplets in intestinal nuclei can be associated with novel bundles of microfilaments (nuclear actin) and membrane tubules that might have roles in damage repair. To increase the normal, low frequency of nuclear lipid droplets in wild-type animals, we used a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants with abnormally large or abundant nuclear lipid droplets. Genetic analysis and cloning of three such mutants showed that the genes encode the lipid regulator SEIP-1/seipin, the inner nuclear membrane protein NEMP-1/Nemp1/TMEM194A, and a component of COPI vesicles called COPA-1/α-COP. We present several lines of evidence that the nuclear lipid droplet phenotype of copa-1 mutants results from a defect in retrieving mislocalized membrane proteins that normally reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. The seip-1 mutant causes most germ cells to have nuclear lipid droplets, the largest of which occupy more than a third of the nuclear volume. Nevertheless, the nuclear lipid droplets do not trigger apoptosis, and the germ cells differentiate into gametes that produce viable, healthy progeny. Thus, our results suggest that nuclear lipid droplets are detrimental to intestinal nuclei, but have no obvious deleterious effect on germ nuclei.},

title ={S-Adenosylmethionine Is Associated with Fat Mass and Truncal Adiposity in Older Adults},
year ={2013},
doi ={10.3945/jn.113.179192},
abstract ={S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is synthesized from methionine, which is abundant in animal-derived protein, in an energyconsuming reaction. SAM and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) correlate with body mass index (BMI). Plasma total concentration of the SAM-associated product cysteine (tCys) correlates with fat mass in humans and cysteine promotes adiposity in animals. In a cross-sectional study of 610 participants, we investigated whether SAM and SAH are associated with BMI via lean mass or fat mass and dietary protein sources as determinants of SAM and tCys concentrations. Plasma SAM was not associated with lean mass, but mean adjusted fat mass increased from 24 kg (95% CI: 22.6, 25.1) to 30 kg (95% CI: 28.7, 31.3) across SAM quartiles (P < 0.001) and trunk fat:total fat ratio increased from 0.48 to 0.52 (P < 0.001). Erythrocyte SAM was also positively associated with fat mass and trunk fat:total fat ratio. The association of SAM with fat mass was not weakened by adjustment for serum tCys, lipids, creatinine, or dietary or lifestyle confounders. Concentrations of the SAM precursor, methionine, and the SAM product, SAH, were not independently associated with adiposity. Intake of animal-derived protein was not related to serum methionine but was positively associated with plasma SAM (partial r = 0.11) and serum tCys (partial r = 0.13; P < 0.05 for both after adjustment for age, gender, and total energy intake). In conclusion, plasma SAM, but not methionine, is independently associated with fat mass and truncal adiposity, suggesting increased conversion of methionine to SAM in obese individuals. Prospective studies are needed to investigate the interactions among dietary energy and animal protein content, SAM concentrations, and change in body weight and cardiometabolic risk. J. Nutr.},

year ={2024},
doi ={10.1093/g3journal/jkae002},
abstract ={The SAM1 and SAM2 genes encode for S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthetase enzymes, with AdoMet serving as the main cellular methyl donor. We have previously shown that independent deletion of these genes alters chromosome stability and AdoMet concentrations in opposite ways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To characterize other changes occurring in these mutants, we grew wildtype, sam1Δ/sam1Δ, and sam2Δ/sam2Δ strains in 15 different Phenotypic Microarray plates with different components and measured growth variations. RNA-Sequencing was also carried out on these strains and differential gene expression determined for each mutant. We explored how the phenotypic growth differences are linked to the altered gene expression, and hypothesize mechanisms by which loss of the SAM genes and subsequent AdoMet level changes, impact pathways and processes. We present 6 stories, discussing changes in sensitivity or resistance to azoles, cisplatin, oxidative stress, arginine biosynthesis perturbations, DNA synthesis inhibitors, and tamoxifen, to demonstrate the power of this novel methodology to broadly profile changes due to gene mutations. The large number of conditions that result in altered growth, as well as the large number of differentially expressed genes with wide-ranging functionality, speaks to the broad array of impacts that altering methyl donor abundance can impart. Our findings demonstrate that some cellular changes are directly related to AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases and AdoMet availability, some are directly linked to the methyl cycle and its role in production of several important cellular components, and others reveal impacts of SAM gene mutations on previously unconnected pathways.},

doi ={10.1093/g3journal/jkad005},
abstract ={Enzymes of one-carbon (1C) metabolism play pivotal roles in proliferating cells. They are involved in the metabolism of amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids and the supply of all cellular methylations. However, there is limited information about how these enzymes are regulated during cell division and how cell cycle kinetics are affected in several loss-of-function mutants of 1C metabolism. Here, we report that the levels of the S. cerevisiae enzymes Ade17p and Cho2p, involved in the de novo synthesis of purines and phosphatidylcholine (PC), respectively, are cell cycleregulated. Cells lacking Ade17p, Cho2p, or Shm2p (an enzyme that supplies 1C units from serine) have distinct alterations in size homeostasis and cell cycle kinetics. Loss of Ade17p leads to a specific delay at START, when cells commit to a new round of cell division, while loss of Shm2p has broader effects, reducing growth rate. Furthermore, the inability to synthesize PC de novo in cho2Δ cells delays START and reduces the coherence of nuclear elongation late in the cell cycle. Loss of Cho2p also leads to profound metabolite changes. Besides the expected changes in the lipidome, cho2Δ cells have reduced levels of amino acids, resembling cells shifted to poorer media. These results reveal the different ways that 1C metabolism allocates resources to affect cell proliferation at multiple cell cycle transitions.},

Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop new prediction methods that use an updated set of 14-3-3-binding motifs for the identification of new 14-3-3 targets and to prioritize the downstream analysis of >2000 potential interactors identified in high-throughput experiments. Results: Here, a comprehensive set of 14-3-3-binding targets from the literature was used to develop 14-3-3-binding phosphosite predictors. Position-specific scoring matrix, support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) classification methods were trained to discriminate experimentally determined 14-3-3-binding motifs from non-binding phosphopeptides. ANN, position-specific scoring matrix and SVM methods showed best performance for a motif window spanning from À6 to þ4 around the binding phosphosite, achieving Matthews correlation coefficient of up to 0.60. Blind prediction showed that all three methods outperform two popular 14-3-3-binding site predictors, Scansite and ELM. The new methods were used for prediction of 14-3-3-binding phosphosites in the human proteome. Experimental analysis of high-scoring predictions in the FAM122A and FAM122B proteins confirms the predictions and suggests the new 14-3-3-predictors will be generally useful. Availability and implementation: A standalone prediction web server is available at http://www. compbio.dundee.ac.uk/1433pred. Human candidate 14-3-3-binding phosphosites were integrated in ANIA: ANnotation and Integrated Analysis of the 14-3-3 interactome database.},

title ={ETF-QO Mutants Uncoupled Fatty Acid β-Oxidation and Mitochondrial Bioenergetics Leading to Lipid Pathology},
year ={2019},
doi ={10.3390/cells8020106},
abstract ={The electron-transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase gene (ETFDH) that encodes the ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QO) has been reported to be the major cause of multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). ETF-QO is an electron carrier that mainly functions in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation and the delivery of electrons to the ubiquinone pool in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. A high frequency of c.250G>A has been found in Taiwanese patients with late-onset MADD. We postulated that the ETFDH c.250G>A mutation may concomitantly impair fatty acid β-oxidation and mitochondrial function. Using MADD patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells and specifically overexpressed ETFDH c.92C>T, c.250G>A, or coexisted c.92C>T and c.250G>A (c.92C>T + c.250G>A) mutated lymphoblastoid cells, we addressed the genotype-phenotype relationship of ETFDH variation in the pathogenesis of MADD. The decreased adenosine triphosphate synthesis, dissipated mitochondrial membrane potentials, reduced mitochondrial bioenergetics, and increased neutral lipid droplets and lipid peroxides were found in the MADD patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells. Riboflavin and/or coenzyme Q10 supplementation rescued cells from lipid droplet accumulation. All three mutant types, c.92C>T, c.250G>A, or c.92C>T + c.250G>A, had increased lipid droplet accumulation after treatment with palmitic acid. These results help to clarify the molecular pathogenesis of MADD as a result of the high frequency of the ETFDH c.250G>A and c.92C>T mutations.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1038/s41598-022-26554-8},
abstract ={Our research group has recently found that radiation-induced airborne stress signals can be used for communication among Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). This paper addresses the question of whether heat stress can also induce the emission of airborne stress signals to alert neighboring C. elegans and elicit their subsequent stress response. Here, we report that heat-stressed C. elegans produces volatile stress signals that trigger an increase in radiation resistance in neighboring unheated C. elegans. When several loss-of-function mutations affecting thermosensory neuron (AFD), heat shock factor-1, HSP-4, and small heat-shock proteins were used to test heat-stressed C. elegans, we found that the production of volatile stress signals was blocked, demonstrating that the heat shock response and ER pathway are involved in controlling the production of volatile stress signals. Our data further indicated that mutations affecting the DNA damage response (DDR) also inhibited the increase in radiation resistance in neighboring unheated C. elegans that might have received volatile stress signals, indicating that the DDR might contribute to radioadaptive responses induction by volatile stress signals. In addition, the regulatory pattern of signal production and action was preliminarily clarified. Together, the results of this study demonstrated that heat-stressed nematodes communicate with unheated nematodes via volatile stress signals.},

title ={Exonuclease Xrn1 regulates TORC1 signaling in response to SAM availability},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.91984.1},
abstract ={Autophagy is a conserved process of cellular self-digestion that promotes survival during nutrient stress. In yeast, methionine starvation is sufficient to induce autophagy. One pathway of autophagy induction is governed by the SEACIT complex, which regulates TORC1 activity in response to amino acids through the Rag GTPases Gtr1 and Gtr2. However, the precise mechanism by which SEACIT senses amino acids and regulates TORC1 signaling remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify the conserved 5'-3' RNA exonuclease Xrn1 as a surprising and novel regulator of TORC1 activity in response to methionine starvation. This role of Xrn1 is dependent on its catalytic activity, but not on degradation of any specific class of mRNAs. Instead, Xrn1 modulates the nucleotide-binding state of the Gtr1/2 complex, which is critical for its interaction with and activation of TORC1. This work identifies a critical role for Xrn1 in nutrient sensing and growth control that extends beyond its canonical housekeeping function in RNA degradation and indicates an avenue for RNA metabolism to function in amino acid signaling into TORC1. eLife assessment This study in budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) presents important findings demonstrating that the exonuclease Xrn1 regulates autophagy in response to methionine deprivation through effects on TORC1. There is solid evidence that the impact of Xrn1 on TORC1 is contingent on its catalytic activity rather than the degradation of any specific category of mRNAs. A major strength is the novel mechanism, in which Xrn1 modulates the nucleotide-binding state of the Gtr1/2 complex.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.122863},
abstract ={Mitochondria play an essential role in various biochemical processes that maintain cellular homeostasis. Minor defects in the mitochondrial genome can lead to aversive behavioral responses in an organism. Nevertheless, little is known about the impact of mitochondrial mutations on the metabolome of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). In this study, an untargeted metabolomics approach was employed to elucidate the metabolic aberrant caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations in C. elegans. Specifically, three mutant strains of C. elegans, including clk-1, mev-1, and phb-2, were adopted to study corresponding metabolic signatures. Adult worms were collected, and metabolites were extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Uni-and multivariate analyses were performed to elucidate perturbed metabolism between wildtype worms and mutant strains, and metabolic differences among the mutants. The tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, amino acids, and sugars were significantly affected in the mitochondrial mutants. Overall, each mitochondrial DNA mutation exhibited a different pattern of metabolic alterations. The shift of metabolome appeared to be associated with the lifespan of C. elegans. In particular, clk-1 and mev-1 strains, which had the opposite phenotypes of lifespan, had apparently different metabolomes. Our findings set light on the metabolic consequences of mitochondrial genetic variants, which may help better understand mitochondrial disease mechanisms.},

doi ={10.7554/eLife.64860},
abstract ={To understand the genetic basis and selective forces acting on longevity, it is useful to examine lifespan variation among closely related species, or ecologically diverse isolates of the same species, within a controlled environment. In particular, this approach may lead to understanding mechanisms underlying natural variation in lifespan. Here, we analyzed 76 ecologically diverse wild yeast isolates and discovered a wide diversity of replicative lifespan (RLS). Phylogenetic analyses pointed to genes and environmental factors that strongly interact to modulate the observed aging patterns. We then identified genetic networks causally associated with natural variation in RLS across wild yeast isolates, as well as genes, metabolites, and pathways, many of which have never been associated with yeast lifespan in laboratory settings. In addition, a combined analysis of lifespanassociated metabolic and transcriptomic changes revealed unique adaptations to interconnected amino acid biosynthesis, glutamate metabolism, and mitochondrial function in long-lived strains. Overall, our multiomic and lifespan analyses across diverse isolates of the same species shows how gene-environment interactions shape cellular processes involved in phenotypic variation such as lifespan.},

abstract ={Posttranslational mechanisms play a key role in modifying the abundance and function of cellular proteins. Among these, modification by advanced glycation end products has been shown to accumulate during aging and age-associated diseases but specific protein targets and functional consequences remain largely unexplored. Here, we devise a proteomic strategy to identify sites of carboxymethyllysine modification, one of the most abundant advanced glycation end products. We identify over 1000 sites of protein carboxymethylation in mouse and primary human cells treated with the glycating agent glyoxal. By using quantitative proteomics, we find that protein glycation triggers a proteotoxic response and indirectly affects the protein degradation machinery. In primary endothelial cells, we show that glyoxal induces cell cycle perturbation and that carboxymethyllysine modification reduces acetylation of tubulins and impairs microtubule dynamics. Our data demonstrate the relevance of carboxymethyllysine modification for cellular function and pinpoint specific protein networks that might become compromised during aging.},

abstract ={C. elegans SET-9 and SET-26 are highly homologous paralogs that share redundant functions in germline development, but SET-26 alone plays a key role in longevity and heat stress response. Whereas SET-26 is broadly expressed, SET-9 is only detectable in the germline, which likely accounts for their different biological roles. SET-9 and SET-26 bind to H3K4me3 with adjacent acetylation marks in vitro and in vivo. In the soma, SET-26 acts through DAF-16 to modulate longevity. In the germline, SET-9 and SET-26 restrict H3K4me3 domains around SET-9 and SET-26 binding sites, and regulate the expression of specific target genes, with critical consequence on germline development. SET-9 and SET-26 are highly conserved and our findings provide new insights into the functions of these H3K4me3 readers in germline development and longevity.},

doi ={10.1007/s11306-021-01775-6},
abstract ={Introduction Lipidomic profiling allows 100s if not 1000s of lipids in a sample to be detected and quantified. Modern lipidomics techniques are ultra-sensitive assays that enable the discovery of novel biomarkers in a variety of fields and provide new insight in mechanistic investigations. Despite much progress in lipidomics, there remains, as for all high throughput "omics" strategies, the need to develop strategies to standardize and integrate quality control into studies in order to enhance robustness, reproducibility, and usability of studies within specific fields and beyond. Objectives We aimed to understand how much results from lipid profiling in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans are influenced by different culture conditions in different laboratories. Methods In this work we have undertaken an inter-laboratory study, comparing the lipid profiles of N2 wild type C. elegans and daf-2(e1370) mutants lacking a functional insulin receptor. Sample were collected from worms grown in four separate laboratories under standardized growth conditions. We used an UPLC-UHR-ToF-MS system allowing chromatographic separation before MS analysis. Results We found common qualitative changes in several marker lipids in samples from the individual laboratories. On the other hand, even in this controlled experimental system, the exact fold-changes for each marker varied between laboratories. Conclusion Our results thus reveal a serious limitation to the reproducibility of current lipid profiling experiments and reveal challenges to the integration of such data from different laboratories.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-021-24634-3},
abstract ={Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant cellular antioxidant. As reactive oxygen species (ROS) are widely believed to promote aging and age-related diseases, and antioxidants can neutralize ROS, it follows that GSH and its precursor, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), are among the most popular dietary supplements. However, the long-term effects of GSH or NAC on healthy animals have not been thoroughly investigated. We employed C. elegans to demonstrate that chronic administration of GSH or NAC to young or aged animals perturbs global gene expression, inhibits skn-1-mediated transcription, and accelerates aging. In contrast, limiting the consumption of dietary thiols, including those naturally derived from the microbiota, extended lifespan. Pharmacological GSH restriction activates the unfolded protein response and increases proteotoxic stress resistance in worms and human cells. It is thus advantageous for healthy individuals to avoid excessive dietary antioxidants and, instead, rely on intrinsic GSH biosynthesis, which is fine-tuned to match the cellular redox status and to promote homeostatic ROS signaling.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.74812},
abstract ={Histone methylation plays crucial roles in the development, gene regulation, and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency in mammals. Recent work shows that histone methylation is associated with aging, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we identified a class of putative histone 3 lysine 9 mono/dimethyltransferase genes (met-2, set-6, set-19, set-20, set-21, set-32, and set-33), mutations in which induce synergistic lifespan extension in the long-lived DAF-2 (insulin growth factor 1 [IGF-1] receptor) mutant in Caenorhabditis elegans. These putative histone methyltransferase plus daf-2 double mutants not only exhibited an average lifespan nearly three times that of wild-type animals and a maximal lifespan of approximately 100 days, but also significantly increased resistance to oxidative and heat stress. Synergistic lifespan extension depends on the transcription factor DAF-16 (FOXO). mRNA-seq experiments revealed that the mRNA levels of DAF-16 Class I genes, which are activated by DAF-16, were further elevated in the daf-2;set double mutants. Among these genes, tts-1, F35E8.7, ins-35, nhr-62, sod-3, asm-2, and Y39G8B.7 are required for the lifespan extension of the daf-2;set-21 double mutant. In addition, treating daf-2 animals with the H3K9me1/2 methyltransferase G9a inhibitor also extends lifespan and increases stress resistance. Therefore, investigation of DAF-2 and H3K9me1/2 deficiency-mediated synergistic longevity will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aging and therapeutic applications.},

title ={Lysosome Lipid Signaling from the Periphery to Neurons Regulates Longevity},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1101/2021.06.10.447794},
abstract ={Lysosomes are key cellular organelles that metabolize extra-and intracellular substrates. Alterations in lysosomal metabolism are implicated in aging-associated metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. However, how lysosomal metabolism actively coordinates the metabolic and nervous systems to regulate aging remains unclear. Here, we report a fat-toneuron lipid signaling pathway induced by lysosomal metabolism and its longevity promoting role in Caenorhabditis elegans. We discovered that lysosomal lipolysis in peripheral fat storage tissue up-regulates the neuropeptide signaling pathway in the nervous system to promote longevity. This cell-non-autonomous regulation requires the secretion from the fat storage tissue of a lipid chaperone protein LBP-3 and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). LBP-3 binds to specific PUFAs, and acts through a nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49 and neuropeptide NLP-11 in neurons to extend lifespan. Together, these results reveal lysosomes as a signaling hub to coordinate metabolism and aging, and a lysosomal signaling mechanism that mediates intertissue communication to promote longevity.},

title ={Neuronal SKN-1B modulates nutritional signalling pathways and mitochondrial networks to control satiety},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1009358},
abstract ={The feeling of hunger or satiety results from integration of the sensory nervous system with other physiological and metabolic cues. This regulates food intake, maintains homeostasis and prevents disease. In C. elegans, chemosensory neurons sense food and relay information to the rest of the animal via hormones to control food-related behaviour and physiology. Here we identify a new component of this system, SKN-1B which acts as a central foodresponsive node, ultimately controlling satiety and metabolic homeostasis. SKN-1B, an ortholog of mammalian NF-E2 related transcription factors (Nrfs), has previously been implicated with metabolism, respiration and the increased lifespan incurred by dietary restriction. Here we show that SKN-1B acts in two hypothalamus-like ASI neurons to sense food, communicate nutritional status to the organism, and control satiety and exploratory behaviours. This is achieved by SKN-1B modulating endocrine signalling pathways (IIS and TGF-β), and by promoting a robust mitochondrial network. Our data suggest a food-sensing and satiety role for mammalian Nrf proteins.},

abstract ={Organismal aging involves functional declines in both somatic and reproductive tissues. Multiple strategies have been discovered to extend lifespan across species. However, how age-related molecular changes differ among various tissues and how those lifespan-extending strategies slow tissue aging in distinct manners remain unclear. Here we generated the transcriptomic Cell Atlas of Worm Aging (CAWA, http://mengwanglab. org/atlas) of wild-type and long-lived strains. We discovered cell-specific, age-related molecular and functional signatures across all somatic and germ cell types. We developed transcriptomic aging clocks for different tissues and quantitatively determined how three different pro-longevity strategies slow tissue aging distinctively. Furthermore, through genome-wide profiling of alternative polyadenylation (APA) events in different tissues, we discovered cell-type-specific APA changes during aging and revealed how these changes are differentially affected by the pro-longevity strategies. Together, this study offers fundamental molecular insights into both somatic and reproductive aging and provides a valuable resource for in-depth understanding of the diversity of pro-longevity mechanisms.},

title ={Dietary restriction extends lifespan across different temperatures in the fly},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.10.13.562222},
abstract ={Dietary restriction (DR) has been consistently shown to extend lifespan across a range of taxa. However, it has recently been reported that DR does not extend lifespan at certain, namely lower, temperatures in flies (Drosophila melanogaster). Similar to the interpretation of other findings that appear to question DR's universality, this finding has been interpreted as being an artefact of benign laboratory conditions. Here we re-test this hypothesis, now using a strain that shows robust lifespan extension at 25°C (across three prior experiments), and using a range of 5 diets across two temperatures, 18°C and 21°C. We found the DR longevity response to be robust, extending lifespan irrespective of temperature. We measured fecundity as a positive control for the DR phenotype, and found, as predicted, that DR reduces egg laying. It will be important for results that question DR as a phenotype to not be overinterpreted readily, as with a substantially larger sample size and a larger range of diets we were unable to replicate this prior work. Differences in experimental setup, genetic lines used and variation in the diet-lifespan reaction norm we suggest are responsible for this discrepancy. In addition, starting with a strain and conditions that show a lifespan extension by DR, as we do here, and then changing environment and/or genotype promises a more robust test of DR modulating factors.},

abstract ={Deregulated energy homeostasis represents a hallmark of aging and results from complex geneby-environment interactions. Here, we discovered that reducing the expression of the gene ech-6 encoding enoyl-CoA hydratase remitted fat diet-induced deleterious effects on lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans, while a basal expression of ech-6 was important for survival under normal dietary conditions. Lipidomics revealed that supplementation of fat in ech-6-silenced worms had marginal effects on lipid profiles, suggesting an alternative fat utilization for energy production. Transcriptomics further suggest a causal relation between the lysosomal pathway, energy production, and the longevity effect conferred by the interaction between ech-6 and fat diets. Indeed, enhancing energy production from endogenous fat by overexpressing lysosomal lipase lipl-4 recapitulated the lifespan effects of fat diets on ech-6-silenced worms. Collectively, these results suggest that the gene ech-6 is potential modulator of metabolic flexibility and may be a target for promoting metabolic health and longevity.},

title ={Modular Evolution of the <i>Drosophila</i> Metabolome},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1093/molbev/msab307},
abstract ={Comparative phylogenetic studies offer a powerful approach to study the evolution of complex traits. Although much effort has been devoted to the evolution of the genome and to organismal phenotypes, until now relatively little work has been done on the evolution of the metabolome, despite the fact that it is composed of the basic structural and functional building blocks of all organisms. Here we explore variation in metabolite levels across 50 My of evolution in the genus Drosophila, employing a common garden design to measure the metabolome within and among 11 species of Drosophila. We find that both sex and age have dramatic and evolutionarily conserved effects on the metabolome. We also find substantial evidence that many metabolite pairs covary after phylogenetic correction, and that such metabolome coevolution is modular. Some of these modules are enriched for specific biochemical pathways and show different evolutionary trajectories, with some showing signs of stabilizing selection. Both observations suggest that functional relationships may ultimately cause such modularity. These coevolutionary patterns also differ between sexes and are affected by age. We explore the relevance of modular evolution to fitness by associating modules with lifespan variation measured in the same common garden. We find several modules associated with lifespan, particularly in the metabolome of older flies. Oxaloacetate levels in older females appear to coevolve with lifespan, and a lifespan-associated module in older females suggests that metabolic associations could underlie 50 My of lifespan evolution.},

doi ={10.7554/eLife.58815},
abstract ={The relationship between lipid metabolism and longevity remains unclear. Although fat oxidation is essential for weight loss, whether it remains beneficial when sustained for long periods, and the extent to which it may attenuate or augment lifespan remain important unanswered questions. Here, we develop an experimental handle in the Caenorhabditis elegans model system, in which we uncover the mechanisms that connect long-term fat oxidation with longevity. We find that sustained b-oxidation via activation of the conserved triglyceride lipase ATGL-1, triggers a feedback transcriptional loop that involves the mito-nuclear transcription factor ATFS-1, and a previously unknown and highly conserved repressor of ATGL-1 called HLH-11/AP4. This feedback loop orchestrates the dual control of fat oxidation and lifespan, and shields the organism from lifeshortening mitochondrial stress in the face of continuous fat oxidation. Thus, we uncover one mechanism by which fat oxidation can be sustained for long periods without deleterious effects on longevity.},

title ={Disrupted liver oxidative metabolism in glycine N-methyltransferase-deficient mice is mitigated by dietary methionine restriction},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.1016/j.molmet.2022.101452},
abstract ={Objective: One-carbon metabolism is routinely dysregulated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This includes decreased glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), a critical regulator of s-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Deletion of GNMT in mice increases SAM and promotes liver steatosis. Lower liver oxidative metabolism, as indicated by a decline in gluconeogenesis, citric acid cycle flux, and oxidative phosphorylation contributes to liver steatosis in GNMT-null mice; however, the extent to which higher SAM mediates this phenotype remains unclear. Here, we determined the SAM-dependent impairment in liver oxidative metabolism by loss of GNMT. Methods: GNMT knockout (KO) mice were fed a methionine-restricted diet to prevent increased SAM. 2 H/ 13 C metabolic flux analysis was performed in conscious, unrestrained mice to quantify liver nutrient fluxes. Metabolomics and high-resolution respirometry were used to quantify liver nutrient pool sizes and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, respectively. Folic acid-supplemented and serine/glycine-deficient diets were used independently to further define the metabolic implications of perturbed one-carbon donor availability. Results: Dietary methionine restriction prevented a 75-fold increase in SAM and a 53% rise in triacylglycerides in livers of KO mice. Dietary methionine restriction increased gluconeogenesis, independent of genotype, and restored cytochrome c oxidase respiratory function in KO mice. Citric acid cycle fluxes remained lower in KO mice irrespective of diet. Restricting dietary methionine abrogated markers of increased lipogenesis and folate cycle dysfunction in KO mice. Conclusions: The impaired liver oxidative metabolism following loss of GNMT is both dependent and independent of greater SAM availability. Lower in vivo citric acid cycle flux is independent of increased SAM. In contrast, gluconeogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation are negatively regulated by excess SAM. Lipid accumulation in livers of mice lacking GNMT is also linked to higher SAM.},

doi ={10.1016/j.isci.2024.109789},
abstract ={Mitochondrial function relies on the coordinated transcription of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes to assemble respiratory chain complexes. Across species, the SIN3 coregulator influences mitochondrial functions, but how its loss impacts mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolism in the context of a whole organism is unknown. Exploring this link is important because SIN3 haploinsufficiency causes intellectual disability/autism syndromes and SIN3 plays a role in tumor biology. Here we show that loss of C. elegans SIN-3 results in transcriptional deregulation of mitochondrial-and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, potentially leading to mito-nuclear imbalance. Consistent with impaired mitochondrial function, sin-3 mutants show extensive mitochondrial fragmentation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in vivo imaging, and altered oxygen consumption. Metabolomic analysis of sin-3 mutant animals revealed a mitochondria stress signature and deregulation of methionine flux, resulting in decreased S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and increased polyamine levels. Our results identify SIN3 as a key regulator of mitochondrial dynamics and metabolic flux, with important implications for human pathologies.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-023-36181-0},
abstract ={Flavin containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are promiscuous enzymes known for metabolizing a wide range of exogenous compounds. In C. elegans, fmo-2 expression increases lifespan and healthspan downstream of multiple longevity-promoting pathways through an unknown mechanism. Here, we report that, beyond its classification as a xenobiotic enzyme, fmo-2 expression leads to rewiring of endogenous metabolism principally through changes in one carbon metabolism (OCM). These changes are likely relevant, as we find that genetically modifying OCM enzyme expression leads to alterations in longevity that interact with fmo-2 expression. Using computer modeling, we identify decreased methylation as the major OCM flux modified by FMO-2 that is sufficient to recapitulate its longevity benefits. We further find that tryptophan is decreased in multiple mammalian FMO overexpression models and is a validated substrate for FMO-2. Our resulting model connects a single enzyme to two previously unconnected key metabolic pathways and provides a framework for the metabolic interconnectivity of longevity-promoting pathways such as dietary restriction. FMOs are well-conserved enzymes that are also induced by lifespan-extending interventions in mice, supporting a conserved and important role in promoting health and longevity through metabolic remodeling.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1093/g3journal/jkad029},
abstract ={Abnormal nuclear morphology is suggested to be a hallmark of aging and one such abnormality is nuclear blebbing. However, little is known about whether and how nuclear blebbing participates in animal aging, and what regulates it. In this study, we show that the frequency of nuclear blebbing in the hypodermis increases during aging in wild-type C. elegans. These nuclear blebs are enveloped by the nuclear lamina, the inner and the outer nuclear membrane, and 42% of them contain chromatin. Although nuclear blebbing could lead to DNA loss if chromatin-containing blebs detach and fuse with lysosomes, we find by time-lapse imaging that nuclear blebs rarely detach, and the estimated lifetime of a nuclear bleb is 772 h or 32 days. The amount of DNA lost through nuclear blebbing is estimated to be about 0.1% of the total DNA loss by adult Day 11. Furthermore, the frequency of nuclear blebbing does not correlate with the rate of aging in C. elegans. Old age does not necessarily induce nuclear blebbing, neither does starvation, heat stress, or oxidative stress. Intriguingly, we find that proliferation of germ cells promotes nuclear blebbing.},

title ={An acetylation-mediated chromatin switch governs H3K4 methylation readwrite capability},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.82596},
abstract ={In nucleosomes, histone N-terminal tails exist in dynamic equilibrium between free/ accessible and collapsed/DNA-bound states. The latter state is expected to impact histone N-termini availability to the epigenetic machinery. Notably, H3 tail acetylation (e.g. K9ac, K14ac, K18ac) is linked to increased H3K4me3 engagement by the BPTF PHD finger, but it is unknown if this mechanism has a broader extension. Here, we show that H3 tail acetylation promotes nucleosomal accessibility to other H3K4 methyl readers, and importantly, extends to H3K4 writers, notably methyltransferase MLL1. This regulation is not observed on peptide substrates yet occurs on the cis H3 tail, as determined with fully-defined heterotypic nucleosomes. In vivo, H3 tail acetylation is directly and dynamically coupled with cis H3K4 methylation levels. Together, these observations reveal an acetylation 'chromatin switch' on the H3 tail that modulates read-write accessibility in nucleosomes and resolves the long-standing question of why H3K4me3 levels are coupled with H3 acetylation. Editor's evaluation This is a fundamental study revealing that cis H3 tail acetylation promotes nucleosome accessibility to histone methyl readers and writers. The findings are supported by compelling evidence providing an explanation for long-observed mechanisms of chromatin crosstalk.},

title ={N6-adenosine methylation of ribosomal RNA affects lipid oxidation and stress resistance},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={During stress, global translation is reduced, but specific transcripts are actively translated. How stress-responsive mRNAs are selectively translated is unknown. We show that METL-5 methylates adenosine 1717 on 18S ribosomal RNA in C. elegans, enhancing selective ribosomal binding and translation of specific mRNAs. One of these mRNAs, CYP-29A3, oxidizes the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid to eicosanoids, key stress signaling molecules. While metl-5-deficient animals grow normally under homeostatic conditions, they are resistant to a variety of stresses. metl-5 mutant worms also show reduced bioactive lipid eicosanoids and dietary supplementation of eicosanoid products of CYP-29A3 restores stress sensitivity of metl-5 mutant worms. Thus, methylation of a specific residue of 18S rRNA by METL-5 selectively enhances translation of cyp-29A3 to increase production of eicosanoids, and blocking this pathway increases stress resistance. This study suggests that ribosome methylation can facilitate selective translation, providing another layer of regulation of the stress response.},

year ={2024},
doi ={10.1101/2024.02.13.579970},
abstract ={Heterochromatin plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and maintaining genome integrity. While structural and enzymatic components have been linked to heterochromatin establishment, a comprehensive view of the underlying pathways at diverse heterochromatin domains remains elusive. Here, we developed a systematic approach to identify factors involved in heterochromatin silencing at pericentromeres, subtelomeres, and the silent mating type locus in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Using quantitative measures, iterative genetic screening, and domain-specific heterochromatin reporters, we identified 369 mutants with different degrees of reduced or enhanced silencing. As expected, mutations in the core heterochromatin machinery globally decreased silencing. However, most other mutants exhibited distinct qualitative and quantitative profiles that indicate domain-specific functions. For example, decreased mating type silencing was linked to mutations in heterochromatin maintenance genes, while compromised subtelomere silencing was associated with metabolic pathways. Furthermore, similar phenotypic profiles revealed shared functions for subunits within complexes. We also discovered that the uncharacterized protein Dhm2 plays a crucial role in maintaining constitutive and facultative heterochromatin, while its absence caused phenotypes akin to DNA replication-deficient mutants. Collectively, our systematic approach unveiled a landscape of domain-specific heterochromatin regulators controlling distinct states and identified Dhm2 as a previously unknown factor linked to heterochromatin inheritance and replication fidelity.},

title ={Senescent glia link mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid accumulation},

doi ={10.1038/s41586-024-07516-8},
abstract ={Senescence is a cellular state linked to ageing and age-onset disease across many mammalian species 1,2. Acutely, senescent cells promote wound healing 3,4 and prevent tumour formation 5 ; but they are also pro-inflammatory, thus chronically exacerbate tissue decline. Whereas senescent cells are active targets for anti-ageing therapy 6-11 , why these cells form in vivo, how they affect tissue ageing and the effect of their elimination remain unclear 12,13. Here we identify naturally occurring senescent glia in ageing Drosophila brains and decipher their origin and influence. Using Activator protein 1 (AP1) activity to screen for senescence 14,15 , we determine that senescent glia can appear in response to neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction. In turn, senescent glia promote lipid accumulation in non-senescent glia; similar effects are seen in senescent human fibroblasts in culture. Targeting AP1 activity in senescent glia mitigates senescence biomarkers, extends fly lifespan and health span, and prevents lipid accumulation. However, these benefits come at the cost of increased oxidative damage in the brain, and neuronal mitochondrial function remains poor. Altogether, our results map the trajectory of naturally occurring senescent glia in vivo and indicate that these cells link key ageing phenomena: mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid accumulation.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.09.28.560019},
abstract ={Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, the two most abundant phospholipids in mammalian cells, are synthesized de novo by the Kennedy pathway from choline and ethanolamine, respectively 1-6. Despite the importance of these lipids, the mechanisms that enable the cellular uptake of choline and ethanolamine remain unknown. Here, we show that FLVCR1, whose mutation leads to the neurodegenerative syndrome PCARP 7-9 , transports extracellular choline and ethanolamine into cells for phosphorylation by downstream kinases to initiate the Kennedy pathway. Structures of FLVCR1 in the presence of choline and ethanolamine reveal that both metabolites bind to a common binding site comprised of aromatic and polar residues. Despite binding to a common site, the larger quaternary amine of choline interacts differently with FLVCR1 than does the primary amine of ethanolamine. Structure-guided mutagenesis identified residues that are critical for the transport of ethanolamine, while being dispensable for choline transport, enabling functional separation of the entry points into the two branches of the Kennedy pathway. Altogether, these studies reveal how FLCVR1 is a high-affinity metabolite transporter that serves as the common origin for phospholipid biosynthesis by two branches of the Kennedy pathway.},

doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1007004},
abstract ={Dietary fatty acids can be incorporated directly into phospholipids. This poses a specific challenge to cellular membranes since their composition, hence properties, could greatly vary with different diets. That vast variations in diets are tolerated therefore implies the existence of regulatory mechanisms that monitor and regulate membrane compositions. Here we show that the adiponectin receptor AdipoR2, and its C. elegans homolog PAQR-2, are essential to counter the membrane rigidifying effects of exogenously provided saturated fatty acids. In particular, we use dietary supplements or mutated E. coli as food, together with direct measurements of membrane fluidity and composition, to show that diets containing a high ratio of saturated to monounsaturated fatty acids cause membrane rigidity and lethality in the paqr-2 mutant. We also show that mammalian cells in which AdipoR2 has been knocked-down by siRNA are unable to prevent the membrane-rigidifying effects of palmitic acid. We conclude that the PAQR-2 and AdipoR2 proteins share an evolutionarily conserved function that maintains membrane fluidity in the presence of exogenous saturated fatty acids.},

doi ={10.1038/s43587-024-00578-3},
abstract ={Suppression of target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) by rapamycin ameliorates aging in diverse species. S6 kinase (S6K) is an essential mediator, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here we show that activation of S6K specifically in Drosophila fat-body blocked extension of lifespan by rapamycin, induced accumulation of multilamellar lysosomes and blocked age-associated hyperactivation of the NF-κB-like immune deficiency (IMD) pathway, indicative of reduced inflammaging. Syntaxin 13 mediated the effects of TORC1-S6K signaling on lysosome morphology and inflammaging, suggesting they may be linked. Inflammaging depended on the IMD receptor regulatory isoform PGRP-LC, and repression of the IMD pathway from midlife extended lifespan. Age-related inflammaging was higher in females than in males and was not lowered in males by rapamycin treatment or lowered S6K. Rapamycin treatment also elevated Syntaxin 12/13 levels in mouse liver and prevented age-related increase in noncanonical NF-κB signaling, suggesting that the effect of TORC1 on inflammaging is conserved from flies to mammals.},

abstract ={Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of serum metabolites have the potential to uncover genes that influence human metabolism. Here, we combined an integrative genetic analysis associating serum metabolites to membrane transporters with a coessentiality map of metabolic genes. This analysis revealed a connection between feline leukemia virus subgroup C cellular receptor 1 (FLVCR1)-a plasma membrane protein-and phosphocholine, a downstream metabolite of choline metabolism. Loss of FLVCR1 in human cells and in mice strongly impairs choline metabolism due to a block in choline import. Consistently, CRISPR-based genetic screens identified several components of the membrane phospholipid machinery as synthetic lethal with FLVCR1 loss. Finally, cells lacking FLVCR1 exhibit mitochondrial defects and upregulate the integrated stress response (ISR) through heme regulated inhibitors kinase (HRI). Altogether, these findings identify FLVCR1 as a universal mediator of choline transport in mammals and provide a platform to discover substrates for unknown metabolite transporters.},

abstract ={Biological membranes have a stunning ability to adapt their composition in response to physiological stress and metabolic challenges. Little is known how such perturbations affect individual organelles in eukaryotic cells. Pioneering work has provided insights into the subcellular distribution of lipids in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but the composition of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, which also crucially regulates lipid metabolism and the unfolded protein response, remains insufficiently characterized. Here, we describe a method for purifying organelle membranes from yeast, MemPrep. We demonstrate the purity of our ER membrane preparations by proteomics, and document the general utility of MemPrep by isolating vacuolar membranes. Quantitative lipidomics establishes the lipid composition of the ER and the vacuolar membrane. Our findings provide a baseline for studying membrane protein biogenesis and have important implications for understanding the role of lipids in regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR). The combined preparative and analytical MemPrep approach uncovers dynamic remodeling of ER membranes in stressed cells and establishes distinct molecular fingerprints of lipid bilayer stress.},

title ={Homeostatic control of stearoyl desaturase expression via patched-like receptor PTR-23 ensures the survival of C. elegans during heat stress},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1011067},
abstract ={Organismal responses to temperature fluctuations include an evolutionarily conserved cytosolic chaperone machinery as well as adaptive alterations in lipid constituents of cellular membranes. Using C. elegans as a model system, we asked whether adaptable lipid homeostasis is required for survival during physiologically relevant heat stress. By systematic analyses of lipid composition in worms during and before heat stress, we found that unsaturated fatty acids are reduced in heat-stressed animals. This is accompanied by the transcriptional downregulation of fatty acid desaturase enzymes encoded by fat-1, fat-3, fat-4, fat-5, fat-6, and fat-7 genes. Conversely, overexpression of the Δ9 desaturase FAT-7, responsible for the synthesis of PUFA precursor oleic acid, and supplementation of oleic acid causes accelerated death of worms during heat stress. Interestingly, heat stress causes permeability defects in the worm's cuticle. We show that fat-7 expression is reduced in the permeability defective collagen (PDC) mutant, dpy-10, known to have enhanced heat stress resistance (HSR). Further, we show that the HSR of dpy-10 animals is dependent on the upregulation of PTR-23, a patched-like receptor in the epidermis, and that PTR-23 downregulates the expression of fat-7. Consequently, abrogation of ptr-23 in wild type animals affects its survival during heat stress. This study provides evidence for the negative regulation of fatty acid desaturase expression in the soma of C. elegans via the non-canonical role of a patched receptor signaling component. Taken together, this constitutes a skingut axis for the regulation of lipid desaturation to promote the survival of worms during heat stress.},

title ={Glutathione supports lipid abundance<i>in vivo</i>},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.02.10.524960},
abstract ={Cells rely on antioxidants to survive. The most abundant antioxidant is glutathione (GSH). The synthesis of GSH is non-redundantly controlled by the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC). GSH imbalance is implicated in many diseases, but the requirement for GSH in adult tissues is unclear. To interrogate this, we developed a series of in vivo models to induce Gclc deletion in adult animals. We find that GSH is essential to lipid abundance in vivo. GSH levels are reported to be highest in liver tissue, which is also a hub for lipid production. While the loss of GSH did not cause liver failure, it decreased lipogenic enzyme expression, circulating triglyceride levels, and fat stores. Mechanistically, we found that GSH promotes lipid abundance by repressing NRF2, a transcription factor induced by oxidative stress. These studies identify GSH as a fulcrum in the liver's balance of redox buffering and triglyceride production.},

title ={Defects in lipid homeostasis reflect the function of TANGO2 in phospholipid and neutral lipid metabolism},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.85345},
abstract ={We show that TANGO2 in mammalian cells localizes predominantly to mitochondria and partially at mitochondria sites juxtaposed to lipid droplets (LDs) and the endoplasmic reticulum. HepG2 cells and fibroblasts of patients lacking TANGO2 exhibit enlarged LDs. Quantitative lipidomics revealed a marked increase in lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and a concomitant decrease in its biosynthetic precursor phosphatidic acid (PA). These changes were exacerbated in nutrientstarved cells. Based on our data, we suggest that TANGO2 function is linked to acyl-CoA metabolism, which is necessary for the acylation of LPA to generate PA. The defect in acyl-CoA availability impacts the metabolism of many other fatty acids, generates high levels of reactive oxygen species, and promotes lipid peroxidation. We suggest that the increased size of LDs is a combination of enrichment in peroxidized lipids and a defect in their catabolism. Our findings help explain the physiological consequence of mutations in TANGO2 that induce acute metabolic crises, including rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrhythmias, often leading to fatality upon starvation and stress. Editor's evaluation This important manuscript describes a series of cellular phenotypes associated with the depletion of TANGO2, a poorly characterized gene product but relevant to neurological and muscular disorders. The authors present solid data indicating that TANGO2 associates with membrane-bound organelles, mainly mitochondria, impacting lipid metabolism and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species.},

title ={Lipid-Restricted Culture Media Reveal Unexpected Cancer Cell Sensitivities},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.1021/acschembio.3c00699},
abstract ={Cancer cell culture models frequently rely on fetal bovine serum as a source of protein and lipid factors that support cell survival and proliferation; however, serum-containing media imperfectly mimic the in vivo cancer environment. Recent studies suggest that typical serum-containing cell culture conditions can mask cancer dependencies, for example, on cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes, that exist in vivo and emerge when cells are cultured in media that provide more realistic levels of lipids. Here, we describe a high-throughput screen that identified fenretinide and ivermectin as small molecules whose cytotoxicity is greatly enhanced in lipid-restricted media formulations. The mechanism of action studies indicates that ivermectin-induced cell death involves oxidative stress, while fenretinide likely targets delta 4-desaturase, sphingolipid 1, a lipid desaturase necessary for ceramide synthesis, to induce cell death. Notably, both fenretinide and ivermectin have previously demonstrated in vivo anticancer efficacy despite their low cytotoxicity under typical cell culture conditions. These studies suggest ceramide synthesis as a targetable vulnerability of cancer cells cultured under lipid-restricted conditions and reveal a general screening strategy for identifying additional cancer dependencies masked by the superabundance of medium lipids.},

title ={Partitioning to ordered membrane domains regulates the kinetics of secretory traffic},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.89306.2},
abstract ={The organelles of eukaryotic cells maintain distinct protein and lipid compositions required for their specific functions. The mechanisms by which many of these components are sorted to their specific locations remain unknown. While some motifs mediating subcellular protein localization have been identified, many membrane proteins and most membrane lipids lack known sorting determinants. A putative mechanism for sorting of membrane components is based on membrane domains known as lipid rafts, which are laterally segregated nanoscopic assemblies of specific lipids and proteins. To assess the role of such domains in the secretory pathway, we applied a robust tool for synchronized secretory protein traffic (RUSH, Retention Using Selective Hooks) to protein constructs with defined affinity for raft phases. These constructs consist solely of single-pass transmembrane domains (TMDs) and, lacking other sorting determinants, constitute probes for membrane domain-mediated trafficking. We find that while raft affinity can be sufficient for steady-state PM localization, it is not sufficient for rapid exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is instead mediated by a short cytosolic peptide motif. In contrast, we find that Golgi exit kinetics are highly dependent on raft affinity, with raft preferring probes exiting Golgi ∼2.5-fold faster than probes with minimal raft affinity. We rationalize these observations with a kinetic model of secretory trafficking, wherein Golgi export can be facilitated by protein association with raft domains. These observations support a role for raft-like membrane domains in the secretory pathway and establish an experimental paradigm for dissecting its underlying machinery. eLife assessment In this important study, Castello-Serrano and colleagues describe, model and quantify the role of transmembrane domains in protein sorting in the secretory pathway, first at the ER and subsequently at the Golgi. Convincing data support the role of a cytoplasmic motif in ER exit, while further experiments are necessary to support a direct connection between the phase partitioning capability of the transmembrane regions and the sorting potential of domains at the Golgi/TGN.},

title ={Mechanisms determining the morphology of the peripheral ER},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) consists of the nuclear envelope and a peripheral network of tubules and membrane sheets. The tubules are shaped by the curvature-stabilizing proteins reticulons and DP1/Yop1p, but how the sheets are formed is unclear. Here we identify several sheet-enriched membrane proteins in the mammalian ER, including proteins that translocate and modify newly synthesized polypeptides, as well as coiled-coil membrane proteins that are highly upregulated in cells with proliferated ER sheets, all of which are localized by membrane-bound polysomes. These results indicate that sheets and tubules correspond to rough and smooth ER, respectively. One of the coiled-coil proteins, Climp63, serves as a "luminal ER spacer" and forms sheets when overexpressed. More universally, however, sheet-formation appears to involve the reticulons and DP1/Yop1p, which localize to sheet edges and whose abundance determines the ratio of sheets to tubules. These proteins may generate sheets by stabilizing the high curvature of edges.},

abstract ={Phospholipase C (PLC) is a key enzyme that regulates physiological processes via lipid and calcium signaling. Despite advances in protein engineering, no tools are available for direct PLC control. Here, we developed a novel optogenetic tool, light-controlled PLCb (opto-PLCb). Opto-PLCb uses a light-induced dimer module, which directs an engineered PLC to the plasma membrane in a light-dependent manner. Our design includes an autoinhibitory capacity, ensuring stringent control over PLC activity. Opto-PLCb triggers reversible calcium responses and lipid dynamics in a restricted region, allowing precise spatiotemporal control of PLC signaling. Using our system, we discovered that phospholipase D-mediated phosphatidic acid contributes to diacylglycerol clearance on the plasma membrane. Moreover, we extended its applicability in vivo, demonstrating that opto-PLCb can enhance amygdala synaptic plasticity and associative fear learning in mice. Thus, opto-PLCb offers precise spatiotemporal control, enabling comprehensive investigation of PLC-mediated signaling pathways, lipid dynamics, and their physiological consequences in vivo.},

abstract ={How cells maintain vital membrane lipid homeostasis while obtaining most of their constituent fatty acids from a varied diet remains largely unknown. Here, we report the first whole-organism (Caenorhabditis elegans) forward genetic screen to identify genes essential for tolerance to dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs). We found that only the PAQR-2/IGLR-2 pathway, homologous to the human adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2) pathway, is uniquely essential to prevent SFA-mediated toxicity. When provided a SFA-rich diet, worms lacking either protein accumulate an excess of SFAs in their membrane phospholipids, which is accompanied by membrane rigidification. Additionally, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to show that the interaction between PAQR-2 and IGLR-2 is regulated by membrane fluidity, suggesting a mechanism by which this protein complex senses membrane properties. We also created versions of PAQR-2 that lacked parts of the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain and showed that these were still functional, though still dependent on the interaction with IGLR-2. We conclude that membrane homeostasis via the PAQR-2/IGLR-2 fluidity sensor is the only pathway specifically essential for the non-toxic uptake of dietary SFAs in C. elegans.},

title ={Hyperacetylated histone H4 is a source of carbon contributing to lipid synthesis},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.1038/s44318-024-00053-0},
abstract ={Histone modifications commonly integrate environmental cues with cellular metabolic outputs by affecting gene expression. However, chromatin modifications such as acetylation do not always correlate with transcription, pointing towards an alternative role of histone modifications in cellular metabolism. Using an approach that integrates mass spectrometry-based histone modification mapping and metabolomics with stable isotope tracers, we demonstrate that elevated lipids in acetyltransferase-depleted hepatocytes result from carbon atoms derived from deacetylation of hyperacetylated histone H4 flowing towards fatty acids. Consistently, enhanced lipid synthesis in acetyltransferase-depleted hepatocytes is dependent on histone deacetylases and acetyl-CoA synthetase ACSS2, but not on the substrate specificity of the acetyltransferases. Furthermore, we show that during diet-induced lipid synthesis the levels of hyperacetylated histone H4 decrease in hepatocytes and in mouse liver. In addition, overexpression of acetyltransferases can reverse diet-induced lipogenesis by blocking lipid droplet accumulation and maintaining the levels of hyperacetylated histone H4. Overall, these findings highlight hyperacetylated histones as a metabolite reservoir that can directly contribute carbon to lipid synthesis, constituting a novel function of chromatin in cellular metabolism.},

title ={The TWK-26 potassium channel governs nutrient absorption in the<i>C. elegans</i>intestine},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.1101/2024.05.06.592787},
abstract ={Ion channels are necessary for proper water and nutrient absorption in the intestine, which supports cellular metabolism and organismal growth. While a role for Na + co-transporters and pumps in intestinal nutrient absorption is well defined, how individual K + uniporters function to maintain ion homeostasis is poorly understood. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that a gain-of-function mutation in twk-26, which encodes a two-pore domain K + ion channel orthologous to human KCNK3, facilitates nutrient absorption and suppresses the metabolic and developmental defects displayed by impaired intestinal MAP Kinase (MAPK) signaling. Mutations in drl-1 and flr-4, which encode two components of this MAPK pathway, cause severe growth defects, reduced lipid storage, and a dramatic increase in autophagic lysosomes, which mirror dietary restriction phenotypes. Additionally, these MAPK mutants display structural defects of the intestine and an impaired defecation motor program. We find that activation of TWK-26 reverses the dietary restriction-like state of the MAPK mutants by restoring intestinal nutrient absorption without correcting the intestinal bloating or defecation defects. This study provides unique insight into the mechanisms by which intestinal K + ion channels support intestinal metabolic homeostasis.},

title ={Distribution of cholesterol in asymmetric membranes driven by composition and differential stress},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.1016/j.bpj.2022.07.032},
abstract ={Many lipid membranes of eukaryotic cells are asymmetric, which means the two leaflets differ in at least one physical property, such as lipid composition or lateral stress. Maintaining this asymmetry is helped by the fact that ordinary phospholipids rarely transition between leaflets, but cholesterol is an exception: its flip-flop times are in the microsecond range, so that its distribution between leaflets is determined by a chemical equilibrium. In particular, preferential partitioning can draw cholesterol into a more saturated leaflet, and phospholipid number asymmetry can force it out of a compressed leaflet. Combining highly coarse-grained membrane simulations with theoretical modeling, we investigate how these two driving forces play against each other until cholesterol's chemical potential is equilibrated. The theory includes two coupled elastic sheets and a Flory-Huggins mixing free energy with a c parameter. We obtain a relationship between c and the interaction strength between cholesterol and lipids in either of the two leaflets, and we find that it depends, albeit weakly, on lipid number asymmetry. The differential stress measurements under various asymmetry conditions agree with our theoretical predictions. Using the two kinds of asymmetries in combination, we find that it is possible to counteract the phospholipid number bias, and the resultant stress in the membrane, via the control of cholesterol mixing in the leaflets.},

abstract ={The mammalian brain relies on neurochemistry to fulfill its functions. Yet, the complexity of the brain metabolome and its changes during diseases or aging remain poorly understood. Here, we generate a metabolome atlas of the aging wildtype mouse brain from 10 anatomical regions spanning from adolescence to old age. We combine data from three assays and structurally annotate 1,547 metabolites. Almost all metabolites significantly differ between brain regions or age groups, but not by sex. A shift in sphingolipid patterns during aging related to myelin remodeling is accompanied by large changes in other metabolic pathways. Functionally related brain regions (brain stem, cerebrum and cerebellum) are also metabolically similar. In cerebrum, metabolic correlations markedly weaken between adolescence and adulthood, whereas at old age, cross-region correlation patterns reflect decreased brain segregation. We show that metabolic changes can be mapped to existing gene and protein brain atlases. The brain metabolome atlas is publicly available (https:// mouse.atlas.metabolomics.us/) and serves as a foundation dataset for future metabolomic studies.},

title ={The existence of a nonclassical TCA cycle in the nucleus that wires the metabolic-epigenetic circuitry},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1038/s41392-021-00774-2},
abstract ={The scope and variety of the metabolic intermediates from the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle that are engaged in epigenetic regulation of the chromatin function in the nucleus raise an outstanding question about how timely and precise supply/ consumption of these metabolites is achieved in the nucleus. We report here the identification of a nonclassical TCA cycle in the nucleus (nTCA cycle). We found that all the TCA cycle-associated enzymes including citrate synthase (CS), aconitase 2 (ACO2), isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3), oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS), fumarate hydratase (FH), and malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2), except for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), a component of electron transport chain for generating ATP, exist in the nucleus. We showed that these nuclear enzymes catalyze an incomplete TCA cycle similar to that found in cyanobacteria. We propose that the nTCA cycle is implemented mainly to generate/consume metabolic intermediates, not for energy production. We demonstrated that the nTCA cycle is intrinsically linked to chromatin dynamics and transcription regulation. Together, our study uncovers the existence of a nonclassical TCA cycle in the nucleus that links the metabolic pathway to epigenetic regulation.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.3390/ijms23042146},
abstract ={Heat stress affects granulosa cells and the ovarian follicular microenvironment, ultimately resulting in poor oocyte developmental competence. This study aims to investigate the metabolomics response of bovine granulosa cells (bGCs) to in vitro acute heat stress of 43 • C. Heat stress triggers oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in cultured bGCs. Heat-stressed bGCs exhibited a time-dependent recovery of proliferation potential by 48 h. A total of 119 metabolites were identified through LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics of the spent culture media, out of which, 37 metabolites were determined as differentially involved in metabolic pathways related to bioenergetics support mechanisms and the physical adaptations of bGCs. Multiple analyses of metabolome data identified choline, citric acid, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid, glutamine, and glycocyamine as being upregulated, while galactosamine, AICAR, ciliatine, 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, lysine, succinic acid, uridine, xanthine, and uraconic acid were the important downregulated metabolites in acute heat stress. These differential metabolites were implicated in various important metabolic pathways directed towards bioenergetics support mechanisms including glycerophospholipid metabolism, the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and serine, threonine, and tyrosine metabolism. Our study presents important metabolites and metabolic pathways involved in the adaptation of bGCs to acute heat stress in vitro.},

Recent findings have demonstrated how mitochondrial oxida tive phosphorylation (OxPhos) defects increase the energetic cost of living and that excessive integrated stress response (ISR) signal ing may prevent cellular identity transitions during development. In this perspective, we discuss general bioenergetic principles of life transitions and the costly molecular processes involved in reprograming the cellular hardware/software as cells shift identity. The energetic cost of cellular differentiation has not been directly quantified, representing a gap in knowledge. We propose that the ISR is an energetic checkpoint evolved to (i) prevent OxPhosdeficient cells from engaging in excessively costly transitions and (ii) allow ISRpositive cells to recruit systemic energetic resources by signaling via GDF15 and the brain.},

abstract ={Mutations that perturb leptin-melanocortin signaling are known to cause hyperphagia and obesity, but energy expenditure has not been well studied outside rodents. We report on a common canine mutation in proopiomelanocortin (POMC), which prevents production of β-melanocytestimulating hormone (β-MSH) and βendorphin but not α-MSH; humans, similar to dogs, produce α-MSH and β-MSH from the POMC propeptide, but rodents produce only α-MSH. We show that energy expenditure is markedly lower in affected dogs, which also have increased motivational salience in response to a food cue, indicating increased wanting or hunger. There was no difference in satiety at a modified ad libitum meal or in their hedonic response to food, nor disruption of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or thyroid axes. In vitro, we show that β-MSH signals comparably to α-MSH at melanocortin receptors. These data implicate β-MSH and βendorphin as important in determining hunger and moderating energy expenditure and suggest that this role is independent of the presence of α-MSH.},

title ={Dynamics of co-substrate pools can constrain and regulate metabolic fluxes},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={Cycling of co-substrates, whereby a metabolite is converted among alternate forms via different reactions, is ubiquitous in metabolism. Several cycled co-substrates are well known as energy and electron carriers (e.g. ATP and NAD(P)H), but there are also other metabolites that act as cycled co-substrates in different parts of central metabolism. Here, we develop a mathematical framework to analyse the effect of co-substrate cycling on metabolic flux. In the cases of a single reaction and linear pathways, we find that co-substrate cycling imposes an additional flux limit on a reaction, distinct to the limit imposed by the kinetics of the primary enzyme catalysing that reaction. Using analytical methods, we show that this additional limit is a function of the total pool size and turnover rate of the cycled co-substrate. Expanding from this insight and using simulations, we show that regulation of these two parameters can allow regulation of flux dynamics in branched and coupled pathways. To support these theoretical insights, we analysed existing flux measurements and enzyme levels from the central carbon metabolism and identified several reactions that could be limited by the dynamics of co-substrate cycling. We discuss how the limitations imposed by co-substrate cycling provide experimentally testable hypotheses on specific metabolic phenotypes. We conclude that measuring and controlling co-substrate dynamics is crucial for understanding and engineering metabolic fluxes in cells.},

title ={A feedback loop engaging propionate catabolism intermediates controls mitochondrial morphology},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.1038/s41556-022-00883-2},
abstract ={itochondrial oxidation of carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids generates acetyl-coA and many organic acid intermediates, which are oxidized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle or used for macromolecule biosynthesis. Abnormal accumulation of such intermediates often leads to organic acidurias or organic acidaemias 1-3. Although patients with organic acidaemia frequently exhibit features of mitochondrial disorders 1 , it is largely unknown how individual organic acid intermediates affect mitochondrial homeostasis. D-2HG is a mitochondrial organic acid derived from the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). In humans, D-2HG is produced together with succinic semialdehyde (SSA) by the hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase (HOT; encoded by ADHFE1), using γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and α-KG as co-substrates 4. D-2HG is rapidly converted back to α-KG by D-2HG dehydrogenase (D2HGDH). D-2HG accumulation leads to a rare and devastating developmental disorder, d-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA) 5,6. D-2HG is also implicated in cancers with neomorphic gain-of-function mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2, which plays debatable roles in tumorigenesis 7-10. The effects of D-2HG on mitochondrion-related disease pathology are not currently understood. Similar to D-2HG, 3-HP is a highly toxic intermediate of mitochondrial oxidation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), propionate and odd-chain fatty acids 11,12. 3-HP is the diagnostic metabolite in propionic acidaemia (PPA) and methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA), two lethal genetic disorders that result from defective propionate catabolism 13-15. Nevertheless, it is not understood how 3-HP exerts adverse effects on mitochondria. Notably, 3-HP is a structural analogue of GHB, a co-substrate for HOT to produce D-2HG. Whether D-2HG and 3-HP are functionally linked to affect mitochondria is unknown. The nematode C. elegans, which is normally fed on Escherichia coli strains that also colonize the intestine, provides an excellent system for dissecting the metabolic and the dietary and gut bacterial effects on mitochondria 16-23. Worms fed on bacteria with or without vitamin B12 (VB12) adopt VB12-dependent or VB12-independent pathways to break down propionate in mitochondria and generate a variety of metabolic intermediates 24. Here, we use unbiased genetic screening to reveal genes and metabolites that affect mitochondrial homeostasis in C. elegans. We identify a mitochondrion-damaging feedback loop that involves D-2HG and 3-HP. We further reveal that dietary and gut bacteria affect mitochondrial health by modulating host 3-HP levels. These results provide mechanistic insights into human diseases related to D-2HG and 3-HP.},

abstract ={Hydrogen peroxide is the preeminent chemical weapon that organisms use for combat. Individual cells rely on conserved defenses to prevent and repair peroxide-induced damage, but whether similar defenses might be coordinated across cells in animals remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a neuronal circuit in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that processes information perceived by two sensory neurons to control the induction of hydrogen peroxide defenses in the organism. We found that catalases produced by Escherichia coli, the nematode's food source, can deplete hydrogen peroxide from the local environment and thereby protect the nematodes. In the presence of E. coli, the nematode's neurons signal via TGFb-insulin/ IGF1 relay to target tissues to repress expression of catalases and other hydrogen peroxide defenses. This adaptive strategy is the first example of a multicellular organism modulating its defenses when it expects to freeload from the protection provided by molecularly orthologous defenses from another species.},

doi ={10.1038/s41419-020-02929-5},
abstract ={Tumor cells adapt their metabolism to meet the energetic and anabolic requirements of high proliferation and invasiveness. The metabolic addiction has motivated the development of therapies directed at individual biochemical nodes. However, currently there are few possibilities to target multiple enzymes in tumors simultaneously. Flavincontaining enzymes, ca. 100 proteins in humans, execute key biotransformations in mammalian cells. To expose metabolic addiction, we inactivated a substantial fraction of the flavoproteome in melanoma cells by restricting the supply of the FMN and FAD precursor riboflavin, the vitamin B2. Vitamin B2 deficiency affected stability of many polypeptides and thus resembled the chaperone HSP90 inhibition, the paradigmatic multiple-target approach. In support of this analogy, flavin-depleted proteins increasingly associated with a number of proteostasis network components, as identified by the mass spectrometry analysis of the FAD-free NQO1 aggregates. Proteome-wide analysis of the riboflavin-starved cells revealed a profound inactivation of the mevalonate pathway of cholesterol synthesis, which underlines the manifold cellular vulnerability created by the flavoproteome inactivation. Cell cyclearrested tumor cells became highly sensitive to alkylating chemotherapy. Our data suggest that the flavoproteome is well suited to design synthetic lethality protocols combining proteostasis manipulation and metabolic reprogramming.},

abstract ={Most bacteria live in dense, spatially structured communities such as biofilms. The high density allows cells to alter the local microenvironment, whereas the limited mobility can cause species to become spatially organized. Together, these factors can spatially organize metabolic processes within microbial communities so that cells in different locations perform different metabolic reactions. The overall metabolic activity of a community depends both on how metabolic reactions are arranged in space and on how they are coupled, i.e., how cells in different regions exchange metabolites. Here, we review mechanisms that lead to the spatial organization of metabolic processes in microbial systems. We discuss factors that determine the length scales over which metabolic activities are arranged in space and highlight how the spatial organization of metabolic processes affects the ecology and evolution of microbial communities. Finally, we define key open questions that we believe should be the main focus of future research.},

abstract ={Induction of the one-carbon cycle is an early hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer metabolism. Vital intermediary steps are localized to mitochondria, but it remains unclear how one-carbon availability connects to mitochondrial function. Here, we show that the one-carbon metabolite and methyl group donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is pivotal for energy metabolism. A gradual decline in mitochondrial SAM (mitoSAM) causes hierarchical defects in fly and mouse, comprising loss of mitoSAM-dependent metabolites and impaired assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Complex I stability and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis are directly controlled by mitoSAM levels, while other protein targets are predominantly methylated outside of the organelle before import. The mitoSAM pool follows its cytosolic production, establishing mitochondria as responsive receivers of onecarbon units. Thus, we demonstrate that cellular methylation potential is required for energy metabolism, with direct relevance for pathophysiology, aging, and cancer.},

abstract ={Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is essential during development and in organ physiology. In the canonical pathway, Hh binding to Patched (PTCH) relieves the inhibition of Smoothened (SMO). Yet, PTCH may also perform SMO-independent functions. While the PTCH homolog PTC-3 is essential in C. elegans, worms lack SMO, providing an excellent model to probe noncanonical PTCH function. Here, we show that PTC-3 is a cholesterol transporter. ptc-3(RNAi) leads to accumulation of intracellular cholesterol and defects in ER structure and lipid droplet formation. These phenotypes were accompanied by a reduction in acyl chain (FA) length and desaturation. ptc-3(RNAi)-induced lethality, fat content and ER morphology defects were rescued by reducing dietary cholesterol. We provide evidence that cholesterol accumulation modulates the function of nuclear hormone receptors such as of the PPARα homolog NHR-49 and NHR-181, and affects FA composition. Our data uncover a role for PTCH in organelle structure maintenance and fat metabolism.},

year ={},
doi ={10.1111/acel.13160},
abstract ={G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate important biological processes in eukaryotes. They regulate the physiology of organ systems, metabolism, lifespan, and behavior. The divergent structure and ligand binding ability of GPCRs allows them to respond to a large variety of chemical, mechanical, and light stimuli. Apart from sensing external cues, GPCRs play central roles in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. In higher animals, GPCRs such as GPR43, GPR119, and GPR120 regulate metabolic homeostasis in response to ghrelin and lipids (Gong et al., 2014; Talukdar, Olefsky, & Osborn, 2011). G protein-coupled receptor repertoire is often larger in lower animals which reside closer to the soil and largely rely on chemosensory cues for perception of food, potential mates, or pathogens. For example, the soil dwelling roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has ~1,500 GPCR encoding genes in its genome (Troemel, Chou, Dwyer, Colbert, & Bargmann, 1995). Earlier, we have shown that two of these GPCRs, NPR-1 and OCTR-1, regulate innate immune responses of C. elegans to Gram negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Styer},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.1038/s42255-020-00285-4},
abstract ={ellular metabolism supports every biological activity within the cell. Metabolic pathways are responsible for the conversion of extracellular nutrients such as glucose, fatty acids, amino acids and vitamins into a wide range of intracellular metabolites. These basic biochemical components can then be combined into complex macromolecules (anabolism) or broken down for the generation of energy and reducing power (catabolism) 1. Because metabolic pathways are highly intersectional, metabolic conversions must be compartmentalized in subcellular locations. Metabolic compartmentalization can be obtained through the formation of local enzyme complexes; temporal separation of reactions; or controlled influx and efflux of metabolites into isolated organelles, such as the mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and peroxisomes 2. However, given the inability of the nuclear pores to prevent the passage of metabolites, the nucleus has long been considered to be in metabolic homeostasis with the cytoplasm 3. Nevertheless, the establishment of the so-called epigenetic code through the chemical modification of chromatin is dependent on the same core metabolites that form the basis of cellular metabolism. Because chromatin modifications are crucial to the maintenance of cellular identity and function, mechanisms regulating nuclear metabolite pools are expected to exist. In this Review, we provide a framework to understand the interaction of cellular and nuclear metabolism, with an emphasis on the nodal metabolites that regulate central carbon metabolism and the epigenome. We give an overview of mechanisms that shield the epigenetic regulation of gene expression from fluctuations in cytoplasmic metabolite levels and discuss the controlled exchange in metabolites between the nuclear and non-nuclear compartments. Finally, we propose that disruption of the nuclear metabolite pools may underlie disease.},

abstract ={Yeast cells respond to heat stress by remodeling their gene expression, resulting in the changes of the corresponding proteins and metabolites. Compared to the intensively investigated transcriptome and proteome, the metabolic response to heat stress is not sufficiently characterized. Mitochondria have been recognized to play an essential role in heat stress tolerance. Given the compartmentalization of the cell, it is not clear if the heat stress-induced metabolic response occurs in mitochondria or in the cytosol. Therefore, a compartment-specific metabolite analysis was performed to analyze the heat stress-induced metabolic response in mitochondria and the cytoplasm. In this work, the isolated mitochondria and the cytoplasm of yeast cells grown at permissive temperature and cells adapting to heat stress were subjected to mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Over a hundred metabolites could be identified, covering amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, arginine metabolism, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, and others. Highly accumulated citrulline and reduced arginine suggested remodeled arginine metabolism. A stable isotope-labeled experiment was performed to analyze the heat stress-induced metabolic remodeling of the arginine metabolism, identifying activated de novo ornithine biosynthesis to support arginine and spermidine synthesis. The short-term increased spermidine and trehalose suggest their important roles as heat stress markers. These data provide metabolic clues of heat stress-induced metabolic remodeling, which helps in understanding the heat stress response.},

abstract ={Recent studies of animal metabolism have revealed large numbers of novel metabolites that are involved in all aspects of organismal biology, but it is unclear to what extent metabolomes differ between sexes. Here, using untargeted comparative metabolomics for the analysis of wildtype animals and sex determination mutants, we show that C. elegans hermaphrodites and males exhibit pervasive metabolomic differences. Several hundred small molecules are produced exclusively or in much larger amounts in one sex, including a host of previously unreported metabolites that incorporate building blocks from nucleoside, carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. A subset of male-enriched metabolites is specifically associated with the presence of a male germline, whereas enrichment of other compounds requires a male soma. Further, we show that one of the male germlinedependent metabolites, an unusual dipeptide incorporating N,N-dimethyltryptophan, increases food consumption, reduces lifespan, and accelerates the last stage of larval development in hermaphrodites. Our results serve as a foundation for mechanistic studies of how the genetic sex of soma and germline shape the C. elegans metabolome and provide a blueprint for the discovery of sex-dependent metabolites in other animals.},

abstract ={Futile cycles are biological phenomena where two opposing biochemical reactions run simultaneously, resulting in a net energy loss without appreciable productivity. Such a state was presumed to be a biological aberration and thus deemed an energy-wasting ''futile'' cycle. However, multiple pieces of evidence suggest that biological utilities emerge from futile cycles. A few established functions of futile cycles are to control metabolic sensitivity, modulate energy homeostasis, and drive adaptive thermogenesis. Yet, the physiological regulation, implication, and pathological relevance of most futile cycles remain poorly studied. In this review, we highlight the abundance and versatility of futile cycles and propose a classification scheme. We further discuss the energetic implications of various futile cycles and their impact on basal metabolic rate, their bona fide and tentative pathophysiological implications, and putative drug interactions.},

doi ={10.1038/s41598-020-74606-8},
abstract ={Current understanding of heat shock response has been complicated by the fact that heat stress is inevitably accompanied by changes in specific growth rates and growth stages. In this study, a chemostat culture was successfully performed to avoid the physico-chemical and biological changes that accompany heatshock, which provided a unique opportunity to investigate the full range of cellular responses to thermal stress, ranging from temporary adjustment to phenotypic adaptation at multi-omics levels. Heat-responsive and time-resolved changes in the transcriptome and metabolome of a widely used E. coli strain BL21(DE3) were explored in which the temperature was upshifted from 37 to 42 °C. Omics profiles were categorized into early (2 and 10 min), middle (0.5, 1, and 2 h), and late (4, 8, and 40 h) stages of heat stress, each of which reflected the initiation, adaptation, and phenotypic plasticity steps of the stress response. The continued heat stress modulated global gene expression by controlling the expression levels of sigma factors in different time frames, including unexpected downregulation of the second heatshock sigma factor gene (rpoE) upon the heat stress. Trehalose, cadaverine, and enterobactin showed increased production to deal with the heat-induced oxidative stress. Genes highly expressed at the late stage were experimentally validated to provide thermotolerance. Intriguingly, a cryptic capsular gene cluster showed considerably high expression level only at the late stage, and its expression was essential for cell growth at high temperature. Granule-forming and elongated cells were observed at the late stage, which was morphological plasticity occurred as a result of acclimation to the continued heat stress. Whole process of thermal adaptation along with the genetic and metabolic changes at fine temporal resolution will contribute to far-reaching comprehension of the heat shock response. Further, the identified thermotolerant genes will be useful to rationally engineer thermotolerant microorganisms.},

title ={Glucose Starvation Alters Heat Shock Response, Leading to Death of Wild Type Cells and Survival of MAP Kinase Signaling Mutant},
year ={2016},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pone.0165980},
abstract ={A moderate heat shock induces Neurospora crassa to synthesize large quantities of heat shock proteins that are protective against higher, otherwise lethal temperatures. However, wild type cells do not survive when carbohydrate deprivation is added to heat shock. In contrast, a mutant strain defective in a stress-activated protein kinase does survive the combined stresses. In order to understand the basis for this difference in survival, we have determined the relative levels of detected proteins in the mutant and wild type strain during dual stress, and we have identified gene transcripts in both strains whose quantities change in response to heat shock or dual stress. These data and supportive experimental evidence point to reasons for survival of the mutant strain. By using alternative respiratory mechanisms, these cells experience less of the oxidative stress that proves damaging to wild type cells. Of central importance, mutant cells recycle limited resources during dual stress by undergoing autophagy, a process that we find utilized by both wild type and mutant cells during heat shock. Evidence points to inappropriate activation of TORC1, the central metabolic regulator, in wild type cells during dual stress, based upon behavior of an additional signaling mutant and inhibitor studies.},

title ={Bacterial adenine cross-feeding stems from a purine salvage bottleneck},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.1093/ismejo/wrae034},
abstract ={Diverse ecosystems host microbial relationships that are stabilized by nutrient cross-feeding. Cross-feeding can involve metabolites that should hold value for the producer. Externalization of such communally valuable metabolites is often unexpected and difficult to predict. Previously, we discovered purine externalization by Rhodopseudomonas palustris by its ability to rescue an Escherichia coli purine auxotroph. Here we found that an E. coli purine auxotroph can stably coexist with R. palustris due to purine cross-feeding. We identified the cross-fed purine as adenine. Adenine was externalized by R. palustris under diverse growth conditions. Computational modeling suggested that adenine externalization occurs via diffusion across the cytoplasmic membrane. RNAseq analysis led us to hypothesize that adenine accumulation and externalization stem from a salvage pathway bottleneck at the enzyme encoded by apt. Ectopic expression of apt eliminated adenine externalization, supporting our hypothesis. A comparison of 49 R. palustris strains suggested that purine externalization is relatively common, with 16 strains exhibiting the trait. Purine externalization was correlated with the genomic orientation of apt, but apt orientation alone could not always explain purine externalization. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of how a communally valuable metabolite can participate in cross-feeding. Our findings also highlight the challenge in identifying genetic signatures for metabolite externalization.},

title ={Cellular zinc status alters chromatin accessibility and binding of transcription factor p53 to genomic sites},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.11.20.567954},
abstract ={Zinc (Zn 2+) is an essential metal required by approximately 2500 proteins. Nearly half of these proteins act on DNA, including > 850 human transcription factors, polymerases, DNA damage response factors, and proteins involved in chromatin architecture. How these proteins acquire their essential Zn 2+ cofactor and whether they are sensitive to changes in the labile Zn 2+ pool in cells remain open questions. Here, we examine how changes in the labile Zn 2+ pool affect chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding to DNA. We observed both increases and decreases in accessibility in different chromatin regions via ATAC-seq upon treating MCF10A cells with elevated Zn 2+ or the Zn 2+-specific chelator tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA). Transcription factor enrichment analysis was used to correlate changes in chromatin accessibility with transcription factor motifs, revealing 477 transcription factor motifs that were differentially enriched upon Zn 2+ perturbation. 186 of these transcription factor motifs were enriched in Zn 2+ and depleted in TPA, and the majority correspond to Zn 2+ finger transcription factors. We selected TP53 as a candidate to examine how changes in motif enrichment correlate with changes in transcription factor occupancy by ChIP-qPCR. Using publicly available ChIP-seq and nascent transcription datasets, we narrowed the 50,000+ ATAC-seq peaks to 2164 TP53 targets and subsequently selected 6 high-probability TP53 binding sites for testing. ChIP-qPCR revealed that for 5 of the 6 targets, TP53 binding correlates with the local accessibility determined by ATAC-seq. These results demonstrate that changes in labile zinc directly alter chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding to DNA.},

abstract ={Cells display complex intracellular organization by compartmentalization of metabolic processes into organelles, yet the resolution of these structures in the native tissue context and their functional consequences are not well understood. Here we resolved the three-dimensional structural organization of organelles in large (more than 2.8 × 10 5 µm 3) volumes of intact liver tissue (15 partial or full hepatocytes per condition) at high resolution (8 nm isotropic pixel size) using enhanced focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy 1,2 imaging followed by deep-learning-based automated image segmentation and 3D reconstruction. We also performed a comparative analysis of subcellular structures in liver tissue of lean and obese mice and found substantial alterations, particularly in hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which undergoes massive structural reorganization characterized by marked disorganization of stacks of ER sheets 3 and predominance of ER tubules. Finally, we demonstrated the functional importance of these structural changes by monitoring the effects of experimental recovery of the subcellular organization on cellular and systemic metabolism. We conclude that the hepatic subcellular organization of the ER architecture are highly dynamic, integrated with the metabolic state and critical for adaptive homeostasis and tissue health.},

However, when investigating the impact of natural compounds or drugs on those topics, a major confounder is the metabolism of these test substances by live E. coli bacteria, the standard food source of C. elegans. Using paraformaldehyde instead of heat to inactivate E. coli, which allows for highthroughput technologies and better food availability, it is shown here that RNA-interference works equally well, thus demonstrating the absence of considerable interfering modifications of paraformaldehyde with nucleic acids.},

abstract ={Acetyl-coenzyme A is a central metabolite that participates in many cellular pathways. Evidence suggests that acetyl-CoA production and consumption are highly compartmentalized in mammalian cells. Yet methods to measure acetyl-CoA in living cells are lacking. In this work, we engineer an acetyl-CoA biosensor from the bacterial protein PanZ and circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP). We biochemically characterize the sensor and demonstrate its selectivity for acetyl-CoA over other CoA species. We then deploy the biosensor in E. coli and HeLa cells to demonstrate its utility in living cells. In E. coli, we show that the biosensor enables detection of rapid changes in acetyl-CoA levels. In human cells, we show that the biosensor enables subcellular detection and reveals the compartmentalization of acetyl-CoA metabolism.},

year ={2018},
doi ={10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00140},
abstract ={Despite purines making up one of the largest classes of metabolites in a cell, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms that facilitate efficient purine production. Under conditions resulting in high purine demand, enzymes within the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway cluster into multienzyme assemblies called purinosomes. Purinosome formation has been linked to molecular chaperones HSP70 and HSP90; however, the involvement of these molecular chaperones in purinosome formation remains largely unknown. Here, we present a new-found biochemical mechanism for the regulation of de novo purine biosynthetic enzymes mediated through HSP90. HSP90-client protein interaction assays were employed to identify two enzymes within the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, PPAT and FGAMS, as client proteins of HSP90. Inhibition of HSP90 by STA9090 abrogated these interactions and resulted in a decrease in the level of available soluble client protein while having no significant effect on their interactions with HSP70. These findings provide a mechanism to explain the dependence of purinosome assembly on HSP90 activity. The combined efforts of molecular chaperones in the maturation of PPAT and FGAMS result in purinosome formation and are likely essential for enhancing the rate of purine production to meet intracellular purine demand. Purine metabolites are responsible for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and growth by supplying the cell with the building blocks for the transfer of genetic information, the *},

abstract ={Metabolism is highly interconnected and also has profound effects on other cellular processes. However, the interactions between metabolites and proteins that mediate this connectivity are frequently low affinity and difficult to discover, hampering our understanding of this important area of cellular biochemistry. Therefore, we developed the MIDAS platform, which can identify protein-metabolite interactions with great sensitivity. We analyzed 33 enzymes from central carbon metabolism and identified 830 proteinmetabolite interactions that were mostly novel, but also included known regulators, substrates, products and their analogs. We validated previously unknown interactions, including two atomic-resolution structures of novel protein-metabolite complexes. We also found that both ATP and long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs inhibit lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), but not LDHB, at physiological concentrations in vitro. Treating cells with long-chain fatty acids caused a loss of pyruvate/lactate interconversion, but only in cells reliant on LDHA. We propose that these regulatory mechanisms are part of the metabolic connectivity that enables survival in an ever-changing nutrient environment, and that MIDAS enables a broader and deeper understanding of that network.},

title ={A Spatiotemporal Compartmentalization of Glucose Metabolism Guides Mammalian Gastrulation Progression},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.06.06.543780},
abstract ={Gastrulation is considered the sine qua non of embryogenesis, establishing a multidimensional structure and the spatial coordinates upon which all later developmental events transpire. At this time, the embryo adopts a heavy reliance on glucose metabolism to support rapidly accelerating changes in morphology, proliferation, and differentiation. However, it is currently unknown how this conserved metabolic shift maps onto the three-dimensional landscape of the growing embryo and whether it is spatially linked to the orchestrated cellular and molecular processes necessary for gastrulation. Here we identify that glucose is utilised during mouse gastrulation via distinct metabolic pathways to instruct local and global embryonic morphogenesis, in a cell type and stagespecific manner. Through detailed mechanistic studies and quantitative live imaging of mouse embryos, in parallel with tractable in vitro stem cell differentiation models and embryo-derived tissue explants, we discover that cell fate acquisition and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) relies on the Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP) branch of glucose metabolism, while newly-formed mesoderm requires glycolysis for correct migration and lateral expansion. This regional and tissue-specific difference in glucose metabolism is coordinated with Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) activity, demonstrating that reciprocal crosstalk between metabolism and growth factor signalling is a prerequisite for gastrulation progression. We expect these studies to provide important insights into the function of metabolism in other developmental contexts and may help uncover mechanisms that underpin embryonic lethality, cancer, and congenital disease.},

title ={Toward modeling metabolic state from singlecell transcriptomics},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1016/j.molmet.2021.101396},
abstract ={Background: Single-cell metabolic studies bring new insights into cellular function, which can often not be captured on other omics layers. Metabolic information has wide applicability, such as for the study of cellular heterogeneity or for the understanding of drug mechanisms and biomarker development. However, metabolic measurements on single-cell level are limited by insufficient scalability and sensitivity, as well as resource intensiveness, and are currently not possible in parallel with measuring transcript state, commonly used to identify cell types. Nevertheless, because omics layers are strongly intertwined, it is possible to make metabolic predictions based on measured data of more easily measurable omics layers together with prior metabolic network knowledge. Scope of Review: We summarize the current state of single-cell metabolic measurement and modeling approaches, motivating the use of computational techniques. We review three main classes of computational methods used for prediction of single-cell metabolism: pathway-level analysis, constraint-based modeling, and kinetic modeling. We describe the unique challenges arising when transitioning from bulk to single-cell modeling. Finally, we propose potential model extensions and computational methods that could be leveraged to achieve these goals. Major Conclusions: Single-cell metabolic modeling is a rising field that provides a new perspective for understanding cellular functions. The presented modeling approaches vary in terms of input requirements and assumptions, scalability, modeled metabolic layers, and newly gained insights. We believe that the use of prior metabolic knowledge will lead to more robust predictions and will pave the way for mechanistic and interpretable machine-learning models.},

abstract ={Metabolism is executed by an efficient, interconnected and ancient biochemical system, the metabolic network. Its evolutionary origins are, however, barely understood. We here discuss that because of niche adaptation, the evolutionary selection acting on the metabolic network structure distinguishes modern species and early life forms. Yet, its basic structure remained conserved over more than three billion years of diverging evolution. We speculate that this situation attributes key roles in metabolic network evolution to (i) the reaction properties of central metabolites, (ii) simple catalysts (e.g. metal ions, amino acids) whose importance remained unchanged during evolution, and (iii) the interconnectivity of the network that limits its expansion. The conservation of network structure hence implies that early life forms already used similar metabolic reaction topologies as modern species.},

doi ={10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2021.11.018},
abstract ={Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a dual role since they can be either beneficial or harmful to living systems. With increasing ROS concentrations, the roles of ROS change from advantageous to detrimental. There seems to be a concentration threshold that determines the transition from their advantageous to detrimental effects. If we purposefully increase the threshold, that is, increase the range of ROS that plays an advantageous role, it should be beneficial for individuals. To test this hypothesis, in C. elegans, the effects of oxidative challenge induced by different concentrations of paraquat (PQ) on nematode lifespan were evaluated. We found that there is a maximum level below which redox stress has benefits and named this threshold as "Redox-stress Signaling Threshold (RST)". Furthermore, we found that starvation (or heat stress or exercise) stimuli at early stage in C. elegans could increase the RST, indicating that this value is not fixed and can be increased by the adaptive response. More intriguingly, we found that increasing RST could improve Redox-stress Response Capacity (RRC) and healthspan, suggesting that increasing the RST value through early stimulation will be an effective strategy to delay aging.},

abstract ={Methylation of carbon-5 of cytosines (m 5 C) is a post-transcriptional nucleotide modification of RNA found in all kingdoms of life. While individual m 5 C-methyltransferases have been studied, the impact of the global cytosine-5 methylome on development, homeostasis and stress remains unknown. Here, using Caenorhabditis elegans, we generated the first organism devoid of m 5 C in RNA, demonstrating that this modification is non-essential. Using this genetic tool, we determine the localisation and enzymatic specificity of m 5 C sites in the RNome in vivo. We find that NSUN-4 acts as a dual rRNA and tRNA methyltransferase in C. elegans mitochondria. In agreement with leucine and proline being the most frequently methylated tRNA isoacceptors, loss of m 5 C impacts the decoding of some triplets of these two amino acids, leading to reduced translation efficiency. Upon heat stress, m 5 C loss leads to ribosome stalling at UUG triplets, the only codon translated by an m 5 C34-modified tRNA. This leads to reduced translation efficiency of UUG-rich transcripts and impaired fertility, suggesting a role of m 5 C tRNA wobble methylation in the adaptation to higher temperatures.},

abstract ={Mitochondria are cellular organelles that control metabolic homeostasis and ATP generation, but also play an important role in other processes, like cell death decisions and immune signaling. Mitochondria produce a diverse array of metabolites that act in the mitochondria itself, but also function as signaling molecules to other parts of the cell. Communication of mitochondria with the nucleus by metabolites that are produced by the mitochondria provides the cells with a dynamic regulatory system that is able to respond to changing metabolic conditions. Dysregulation of the interplay between mitochondrial metabolites and the nucleus has been shown to play a role in disease etiology, such as cancer and type II diabetes. Multiple recent studies emphasize the crucial role of nutritional cofactors in regulating these metabolic networks. Since B-vitamins directly regulate mitochondrial metabolism, understanding the role of B-vitamins in mito-nuclear communication is relevant for therapeutic applications and optimal dietary lifestyle. In this review, we will highlight emerging concepts in mito-nuclear communication and will describe the role of B-vitamins in mitochondrial metabolite-mediated nuclear signaling.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.83853},
abstract ={Argonaute (AGO) proteins associate with small RNAs to direct their effector function on complementary transcripts. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans contains an expanded family of 19 functional AGO proteins, many of which have not been fully characterized. In this work, we systematically analyzed every C. elegans AGO using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to introduce GFP::3xFLAG tags. We have characterized the expression patterns of each AGO throughout development, identified small RNA binding complements, and determined the effects of ago loss on small RNA populations and developmental phenotypes. Our analysis indicates stratification of subsets of AGOs into distinct regulatory modules, and integration of our data led us to uncover novel stress-induced fertility and pathogen response phenotypes due to ago loss. Editor's evaluation This impressive study presents the most comprehensive analysis of the Argonautes, their small RNA partners, their targets, and their biological functions in any species to date. The work provides new insights into Argonaute-based pathways, includes extensive validation of existing models, and describes overall a treasure-trove of reagents and datasets for future exploration of the vast Argonaute world in C. elegans.},

title ={Feedback between a retinoid-related nuclear receptor and the let-7 microRNAs controls the pace and number of molting cycles in C. elegans},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.80010},
abstract ={Animal development requires coordination among cyclic processes, sequential cell fate specifications, and once-a-lifetime morphogenic events, but the underlying timing mechanisms are not well understood. Caenorhabditis elegans undergoes four molts at regular 8 to 10 hour intervals. The pace of the cycle is governed by PERIOD/lin-42 and other as-yet unknown factors. Cessation of the cycle in young adults is controlled by the let-7 family of microRNAs and downstream transcription factors in the heterochronic pathway. Here, we characterize a negative feedback loop between NHR-23, the worm homolog of mammalian retinoid-related orphan receptors (RORs), and the let-7 family of microRNAs that regulates both the frequency and finite number of molts. The molting cycle is decelerated in nhr-23 knockdowns and accelerated in let-7(-) mutants, but timed similarly in let-7(-) nhr-23(-) double mutants and wild-type animals. NHR-23 binds response elements (ROREs) in the let-7 promoter and activates transcription. In turn, let-7 dampens nhr-23 expression across development via a complementary let-7-binding site (LCS) in the nhr-23 3′ UTR. The molecular interactions between NHR-23 and let-7 hold true for other let-7 family microRNAs. Either derepression of nhr-23 transcripts by LCS deletion or high gene dosage of nhr-23 leads to protracted behavioral quiescence and extra molts in adults. NHR-23 and let-7 also coregulate scores of genes required for execution of the molts, including lin-42. In addition, ROREs and LCSs isolated from mammalian ROR and let-7 genes function in C. elegans, suggesting conservation of this feedback mechanism. We propose that this feedback loop unites the molting timer and the heterochronic gene regulatory network, possibly by functioning as a cycle counter.},

title ={Meisosomes, folded membrane microdomains between the apical extracellular matrix and epidermis},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.75906},
abstract ={Apical extracellular matrices (aECMs) form a physical barrier to the environment. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the epidermal aECM, the cuticle, is composed mainly of different types of collagen, associated in circumferential ridges separated by furrows. Here, we show that in mutants lacking furrows, the normal intimate connection between the epidermis and the cuticle is lost, specifically at the lateral epidermis, where, in contrast to the dorsal and ventral epidermis, there are no hemidesmosomes. At the ultrastructural level, there is a profound alteration of structures that we term 'meisosomes,' in reference to eisosomes in yeast. We show that meisosomes are composed of stacked parallel folds of the epidermal plasma membrane, alternately filled with cuticle. We propose that just as hemidesmosomes connect the dorsal and ventral epidermis, above the muscles, to the cuticle, meisosomes connect the lateral epidermis to it. Moreover, furrow mutants present marked modifications of the biomechanical properties of their skin and exhibit a constitutive damage response in the epidermis. As meisosomes co-localise to macrodomains enriched in phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate, they could conceivably act, like eisosomes, as signalling platforms, to relay tensile information from the aECM to the underlying epidermis, as part of an integrated stress response to damage. Editor's evaluation This valuable work addresses the cellular mechanisms that mediate attachment of the lateral epidermis to the cuticle. The evidence supporting the role of structures called 'meisosomes' by the authors is solid, and addresses the roles of these structures in maintaining and patterning the epidermis and cuticle. The work will be of interest to developmental and cell biologists.},

year ={2024},
doi ={10.1093/g3journal/jkae017},
abstract ={All animals must maintain genome and proteome integrity, especially when experiencing endogenous or exogenous stress. To cope, organisms have evolved sophisticated and conserved response systems: unfolded protein responses (UPRs) ensure proteostasis, while DNA damage responses (DDRs) maintain genome integrity. Emerging evidence suggests that UPRs and DDRs crosstalk, but this remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of the DNA primases pri-1 or pri-2, which synthesize RNA primers at replication forks and whose inactivation causes DNA damage, activates the UPR of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPR-ER) in Caenorhabditis elegans, with especially strong activation in the germline. We observed activation of both the inositol-requiring-enzyme 1 (ire-1) and the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (pek-1) branches of the (UPR-ER). Interestingly, activation of the (UPR-ER) output gene heat shock protein 4 (hsp-4) was partially independent of its canonical activators, ire-1 and X-box binding protein (xbp-1), and instead required the third branch of the (UPR-ER), activating transcription factor 6 (atf-6), suggesting functional redundancy. We further found that primase depletion specifically induces the (UPR-ER), but not the distinct cytosolic or mitochondrial UPRs, suggesting that primase inactivation causes compartment-specific rather than global stress. Functionally, loss of ire-1 or pek-1 sensitizes animals to replication stress caused by hydroxyurea. Finally, transcriptome analysis of pri-1 embryos revealed several deregulated processes that could cause (UPR-ER) activation, including protein glycosylation, calcium signaling, and fatty acid desaturation. Together, our data show that the (UPR-ER), but not other UPRs, responds to replication fork stress and that the (UPR-ER) is required to alleviate this stress.},

doi ={10.1101/817130},
abstract ={Despite highly conserved chromatin states and cis-regulatory elements, studies of metazoan genomes reveal that gene organization and the strategies to control mRNA expression can vary widely among animal species. C. elegans gene regulation is often assumed to be similar to that of other model organisms, yet evidence suggests the existence of distinct molecular mechanisms to pattern the developmental transcriptome, including extensive post-transcriptional RNA control pathways, widespread splice leader (SL) trans-splicing of pre-mRNAs, and the organization of genes into operons. Here, we performed ChIP-seq for histone modifications in highly synchronized embryos cohorts representing three major developmental stages, with the goal of better characterizing whether the dynamic changes in embryonic mRNA expression are accompanied by changes to the chromatin state. We were surprised to find that thousands of promoters are persistently marked by active histone modifications, despite a fundamental restructuring of the transcriptome. We employed global run-on sequencing using a long-read nanopore format to map nascent RNA transcription across embryogenesis, finding that the invariant open chromatin regions are persistently transcribed by Pol II at all stages of embryo development, even though the mature mRNA is not produced. By annotating our nascent RNA sequencing reads into directional transcription units, we find extensive evidence of polycistronic RNA transcription genome-wide, suggesting that nearby genes in C. elegans are linked by shared transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We present data indicating that the sharing of cisregulatory sequences has constrained C. elegans gene positioning and likely explains the remarkable retention of syntenic gene pairs over long evolutionary timescales.},

doi ={10.1371/journal.pone.0214257},
abstract ={Due to its ease of genetic manipulation and transparency, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) has become a preferred model system to study gene function by microscopy. The use of Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to proteins or targeting sequences of interest, further expanded upon the utility of C. elegans by labeling subcellular structures, which enables following their disposition during development or in the presence of genetic mutations. Fluorescent proteins with excitation and emission spectra different from that of GFP accelerated the use of multifluorophore imaging in real time. We have expanded the repertoire of fluorescent proteins for use in C. elegans by developing a codonoptimized version of Orange2 (CemOrange2). Proteins or targeting motifs fused to CemOr-ange2 were distinguishable from the more common fluorophores used in the nematode; such as GFP, YFP, and mKate2. We generated a panel of CemOrange2 fusion constructs, and confirmed they were targeted to their correct subcellular addresses by colocalization with independent markers. To demonstrate the potential usefulness of this new panel of fluorescent protein markers, we showed that CemOrange2 fusion proteins could be used to: 1) monitor biological pathways, 2) multiplex with other fluorescent proteins to determine colocalization and 3) gain phenotypic knowledge of a human ABCA3 orthologue, ABT-4, trafficking variant in the C. elegans model organism.},

However, the lamina composition and the dimensions of NPCs vary between plants, yeast, and vertebrates. In this study, we established a protocol that preserves the structure of Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic cells for high-resolution studies with thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We show that the NPCs are bigger in C. elegans embryos than in yeast, with dimensions similar to those in higher eukaryotes. We also localized the C. elegans nuclear envelope proteins Ce-lamin and Ce-emerin by pre-embedding gold labeling immunoelectron microscopy. Both proteins are present at or near the inner nuclear membrane. A fraction of Ce-lamin, but not Ce-emerin, is present in the nuclear interior. Removing the nuclear membranes leaves both Ce-lamin and Ce-emerin associated with the chromatin. Eliminating the single lamin protein caused cell death as visualized by characteristic changes in nuclear architecture including condensation of chromatin, clustering of NPCs, membrane blebbing, and the presence of vesicles inside the nucleus. Taken together, these results show evolutionarily conserved protein localization, interactions, and functions of the C. elegans nuclear envelope.},

They provide solid evidence that this approach generates a sufficient signal, equivalent to the full-length MS2. This work, along with a previously reported similar method will be useful to investigators considering single-molecule imaging in Elegans as well as other organisms.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1083/jcb.201909139},
abstract ={Acute heat stress (aHS) can induce strong developmental defects in Caenorhabditis elegans larva but not lethality or sterility. This stress results in transitory fragmentation of mitochondria, formation of aggregates in the matrix, and decrease of mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, active autophagic flux associated with mitophagy events enables the rebuilding of the mitochondrial network and developmental recovery, showing that the autophagic response is protective. This adaptation to aHS does not require Pink1/Parkin or the mitophagy receptors DCT-1/NIX and FUNDC1. We also find that mitochondria are a major site for autophagosome biogenesis in the epidermis in both standard and heat stress conditions. In addition, we report that the depletion of the dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP-1) affects autophagic processes and the adaptation to aHS. In drp-1 animals, the abnormal mitochondria tend to modify their shape upon aHS but are unable to achieve fragmentation. Autophagy is induced, but autophagosomes are abnormally elongated and clustered on mitochondria. Our data support a role for DRP-1 in coordinating mitochondrial fission and autophagosome biogenesis in stress conditions. .},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1016/j.exger.2021.111622},
abstract ={The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful model organism for studying cell development, apoptosis, neuronal circuits, and aging. The isolate N2 is recognized by the C. elegans community as the reference wild-type strain. Interestingly, the lifespan of presumably isogenic C. elegans N2 worms-even when grown under comparable conditions-varies significantly amongst distinct laboratories. This hinders the inter-laboratory comparability of C. elegans lifespan data and raises questions regarding data interpretation and reproducibility. Here, we hypothesized slight alterations in experimental design and worm handling could explain the observed discrepancies. To test this hypothesis, we collected and assessed data from over 1000 published C. elegans N2 lifespan assays as well as corresponding methodological meta-data. We find that mean N2 lifespans range from approximately 7 days to upwards of 35 days, despite laboratories disclosing seemingly comparable experimental conditions. We further demonstrate that, in addition to temperature, the use of the chemical sterilizer 5-fluoro-2 ′-deoxyuridine (FUDR) may change N2 lifespan. Additionally, we observed differences in average N2 lifespan from experiments originating from distinct geographic locations, indicating a potential effect of location-specific factors on experimental outcomes. Taken as a whole, our work indicates the sum of many small, rather than a few critical, differences in experimental conditions may account for the observed variance in N2 lifespan. We also find that the absence of standardized experimental methods and the insufficient disclosure of experiment details in the peer-reviewed literature limits the inter-lab comparability of published results. We thus propose the establishment of a succinct reporting standard for C. elegans lifespan experiments to increase the reliability and reproducibility, and thus scientific value, of these studies.},

doi ={10.1016/j.exger.2006.06.060},
abstract ={Mitochondria play a pivotal role in the life of cells, controlling diverse processes ranging from energy production to the regulation of cell death. In humans, numerous pathological conditions have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Cancer, diabetes, obesity, neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathy and even aging are all associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Over 400 mutations in mitochondrial DNA result directly in pathology and many more disorders associated with mitochondrial dysfunction arise from mutations in nuclear DNA. It is counter-intuitive then, that a class of mitochondrially defective mutants in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the so called Mit (Mitochondrial) mutants, in fact live longer than wild-type animals. In this review, we will reconcile this paradox and provide support for the idea that the Mit mutants are in fact an excellent model for studying human mitochondrial associated diseases (HMADs). In the context of the 'Mitochondrial Threshold Effect Theory', we propose that the kinds of processes induced to counteract mitochondrial mutations in the Mit mutants (and which mediate their life extension), are very likely the same ones activated in many HMADs to delay disease appearance. The identification of such compensatory pathways opens a window of possibility for future preventative therapies for many HMADs. They may also provide a way of potentially extending human life span.},

title ={Oocyte mitophagy is critical for extended reproductive longevity},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1010400},
abstract ={Women's reproductive cessation is the earliest sign of human aging and is caused by decreasing oocyte quality. Similarly, C. elegans' reproduction declines in mid-adulthood and is caused by oocyte quality decline. Aberrant mitochondrial morphology is a hallmark of age-related dysfunction, but the role of mitochondrial morphology and dynamics in reproductive aging is unclear. We examined the requirements for mitochondrial fusion and fission in oocytes of both wild-type worms and the long-lived, long-reproducing insulin-like receptor mutant daf-2. We find that normal reproduction requires both fusion and fission, but that daf-2 mutants utilize a shift towards fission, but not fusion, to extend their reproductive span and oocyte health. daf-2 mutant oocytes' mitochondria are punctate (fissioned) and this morphology is primed for mitophagy, as loss of the mitophagy regulator PINK-1 shortens daf-2's reproductive span. daf-2 mutants maintain oocyte mitochondria quality with age at least in part through a shift toward punctate mitochondrial morphology and subsequent mitophagy. Supporting this model, Urolithin A, a metabolite that promotes mitophagy, extends reproductive span in wild-type mothers-even in mid-reproduction-by maintaining youthful oocytes with age. Our data suggest that promotion of mitophagy may be an effective strategy to maintain oocyte health with age.},

doi ={10.1101/2021.12.22.473890},
abstract ={Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP) methods have emerged as a powerful approach to profile actively translated transcripts in specific cell and tissue types. Epitope tagged ribosomal subunits are expressed in defined cell populations and used to pull down ribosomes and their associated mRNAs, providing a snapshot of cell type-specific translation occurring in that space and time. Current TRAP toolkits available to the C. elegans community have been built using multi-copy arrays, randomly integrated in the genome. Here we introduce a Single-copy Knock In Translating Ribosome ImmunoPrecipitation (SKI TRIP) tool kit, a collection of C. elegans strains engineered by CRISPR in which tissue specific expression of FLAG tagged ribosomal subunit protein RPL-22 is driven by cassettes present in single copy from defined sites in the genome. In depth characterization of the SKI TRIP strains and methodology shows that 3xFLAG tagged RPL-22 expressed from its endogenous locus or within defined cell types incorporates into actively translating ribosomes and can be used to efficiently and cleanly pull-down cell type specific transcripts without impacting overall mRNA translation or fitness of the animal. We propose SKI TRIP use for the study of processes that are acutely sensitive to changes in translation, such as aging. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

abstract ={The genome of Caenorhabditis elegans encodes 284 nuclear hormone receptor, which perform diverse functions in development and physiology. One of the best characterized of these is NHR-49, related in sequence and function to mammalian hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. Initially identified as regulator of lipid metabolism, including fatty acid catabolism and desaturation, additional important roles for NHR-49 have since emerged. It is an essential contributor to longevity in several genetic and environmental contexts, and also plays vital roles in the resistance to several stresses and innate immune response to infection with various bacterial pathogens. Here, we review how NHR-49 is integrated into pertinent signaling circuits and how it achieves its diverse functions. We also highlight areas for future investigation including identification of regulatory inputs that drive NHR-49 activity and identification of tissue-specific gene regulatory outputs. We anticipate that future work on this protein will provide information that could be useful for developing strategies to age-associated declines in health and age-related human diseases.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.3389/fnmol.2021.786471},
abstract ={One of the reasons that most multicellular animals survive and thrive is because of the adaptable and plastic nature of their nervous systems. For an organism to survive, it is essential for the animal to respond and adapt to environmental changes. This is achieved by sensing external cues and translating them into behaviors through changes in synaptic activity. The nervous system plays a crucial role in constantly evaluating environmental cues and allowing for behavioral plasticity in the organism. Multiple neurotransmitters and neuropeptides have been implicated as key players for integrating sensory information to produce the desired output. Because of its simple nervous system and well-established neuronal connectome, C. elegans acts as an excellent model to understand the mechanisms underlying behavioral plasticity. Here, we critically review how neuropeptides modulate a wide range of behaviors by allowing for changes in neuronal and synaptic signaling. This review will have a specific focus on feeding, mating, sleep, addiction, learning and locomotory behaviors in C. elegans. With a view to understand evolutionary relationships, we explore the functions and associated pathophysiology of C. elegans neuropeptides that are conserved across different phyla. Further, we discuss the mechanisms of neuropeptidergic signaling and how these signals are regulated in different behaviors. Finally, we attempt to provide insight into developing potential therapeutics for neuropeptide-related disorders.},

In Caenorhabditis elegans, however, yolk proteins seem dispensable for fecundity, despite constituting the vast majority of the embryonic protein pool and acting as carriers for nutrient-rich lipids. Here, we used yolk protein-deprived C. elegans mutants to gain insight into the traits that may yet be influenced by yolk rationing. We show that massive yolk provisioning confers a temporal advantage during embryogenesis, while also increasing early juvenile body size and promoting competitive fitness. Opposite to species that reduce egg production under yolk deprivation, our results indicate that C. elegans relies on yolk as a fail-safe to secure offspring survival, rather than to maintain offspring numbers.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1009432},
abstract ={Epigenetic alterations occur as organisms age, and lead to chromatin deterioration, loss of transcriptional silencing and genomic instability. Dysregulation of the epigenome has been associated with increased susceptibility to age-related disorders. In this study, we aimed to characterize the age-dependent changes of the epigenome and, in turn, to understand epigenetic processes that drive aging phenotypes. We focused on the aging-associated changes in the repressive histone marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in C. elegans. We observed region-specific gain and loss of both histone marks, but the changes are more evident for H3K9me3. We further found alteration of heterochromatic boundaries in aged somatic tissues. Interestingly, we discovered that the most statistically significant changes reflected H3K9me3-marked regions that are formed during aging, and are absent in developing worms, which we termed "aging-specific repressive regions" (ASRRs). These ASRRs preferentially occur in genic regions that are marked by high levels of H3K9me2 and H3K36me2 in larval stages. Maintenance of high H3K9me2 levels in these regions have been shown to correlate with a longer lifespan. Next, we examined whether the changes in repressive histone marks lead to de-silencing of repetitive DNA elements, as reported for several other organisms. We observed increased expression of active repetitive DNA elements but not global re-activation of silent repeats in old worms, likely due to the distributed nature of repetitive elements in the C. elegans genome. Intriguingly, CELE45, a putative short interspersed nuclear element (SINE), was greatly overexpressed at old age and upon heat stress. SINEs have been suggested to regulate transcription in response to various cellular stresses in mammals. It is likely that CELE45 RNAs also play roles in stress response and aging in C. elegans. Taken together, our study revealed significant and specific agedependent changes in repressive histone modifications and repetitive elements, providing important insights into aging biology.},

doi ={10.1074/jbc.M609025200},
abstract ={Mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mthsp70) functions as a mitochondrial import motor and is essential in mitochondrial biogenesis and energy generation in eukaryotic cells. HSP-6 (hsp70F) is a nematode orthologue of mthsp70. Knockdown of HSP-6 by RNA interference in young adult nematodes caused a reduction in the levels of ATP-2, HSP-60 and CLK-1, leading to abnormal mitochondrial morphology and lower ATP levels. As a result, RNA interference-treated worms had lower motility, defects in oogenesis, earlier accumulation of autofluorescent material, and a shorter life span. These are the major phenotypes observed during the aging of worms, suggesting that the reduction of HSP-6 causes early aging or progeria-like phenotypes. The amount of HSP-6 became dramatically reduced at the expected mean life span in not only wild-type but also in long and short life span mutant worms (wild-type, daf-2, and daf-16). Mitochondrial HSP-60 and ATP-2 were also reduced following the reduction of HSP-6 during aging. These results suggest that the reduction of HSP-6 causes defects in mitochondrial function at the final stage of aging, leading to mortality.},

title ={Trans-splicing and operons in C. elegans},
year ={2012},
doi ={},
abstract ={About 70% of C. elegans mRNAs are trans-spliced to one of two 22 nucleotide spliced leaders. SL1 is used to trim off the 5' ends of pre-mRNAs and replace them with the SL1 sequence. This processing event is very closely related to cis-splicing, or intron removal. The SL1 sequence is donated by a 100 nt small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP), the SL1 snRNP. This snRNP is structurally and functionally similar to the U snRNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6) that play key roles in intron removal and trans-splicing, except that the SL1 snRNP is consumed in the process. More than half of C. elegans pre-mRNAs are subject to SL1 trans-splicing, whereas ~30% are not trans-spliced. The remaining genes are trans-spliced by SL2, which is donated by a similar snRNP, the SL2 snRNP. SL2 recipients are all downstream genes in closely spaced gene clusters similar to bacterial operons. They are transcribed from a promoter at the 5' end of the cluster of between 2 and 8 genes. This transcription makes a polycistronic pre-mRNA that is cotranscriptionally processed by cleavage and polyadenylation at the 3' end of each gene, and this event is closely coupled to the SL2 trans-splicing event that occurs only ~100 nt further downstream. SL2 trans-splicing requires a sequence between the genes, the Ur element, that likely base pairs with the 5' splice site on the SL2 snRNP, in a manner analogous to the interaction between the 5' splice site in cis-splicing with the U1 snRNP. The key difference is that in trans-splicing, the snRNP contains the 5' splice site, whereas in cis-splicing the pre-mRNA does. Some operons, termed "hybrid operons", contain an additional promoter between two genes that can express the downstream gene or genes with a developmental profile that is different from that of the entire operon. The operons contain primarily genes required for rapid growth, including genes whose products are needed for mitochondrial function and the basic machinery of gene expression. Recent evidence suggests that RNA polymerase is poised at the promoters of growth genes, and operons allow more efficient recovery from growth-arrested states, resulting in reduction in the need for this cache of inactive RNA polymerase.},

abstract ={Significance Gamete production requires tightly regulated interactions between the parental chromosomes, which coalign and exchange information. These events are mediated by the synaptonemal complex-a ladder-like structure that assembles between the parental chromosomes. The molecular interactions that underlie synaptonemal complex assembly remain poorly understood due to rapid sequence divergence and challenges in biochemical reconstitution. Our detailed genetic data suggests a threecomponent interface in the nematode synaptonemal complex. Destabilization and subsequent restoration of this interface link synaptonemal complex integrity with chromosome alignment and regulation of exchanges. Beyond mechanistic understanding of chromosomal interactions, our work provides a blueprint for genetic probing of large cellular assemblies that are refractory to structural analysis and sheds light on the forces that shape their evolution.},

abstract ={Mitochondria are central regulators of healthspan and lifespan, yet the intricate choreography of multiple, tightly controlled steps regulating mitochondrial biogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover a pivotal role for specific elements of the 5 0-3 0 mRNA degradation pathway in the regulation of mitochondrial abundance and function. We find that the mRNA degradation and the poly-A tail deadenylase CCR4-NOT complexes form distinct foci in somatic Caenorhabditis elegans cells that physically and functionally associate with mitochondria. Components of these two multi-subunit complexes bind transcripts of nuclear-encoded mitochondria-targeted proteins to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis during ageing in an opposite manner. In addition, we show that balanced degradation and storage of mitochondria-targeted protein mRNAs are critical for mitochondrial homeostasis, stress resistance and longevity. Our findings reveal a multifaceted role of mRNA metabolism in mitochondrial biogenesis and show that finetuning of mRNA turnover and local translation control mitochondrial abundance and promote longevity in response to stress and during ageing.},

title ={Using single-worm RNA sequencing to study C. elegans responses to pathogen infection},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.1186/s12864-022-08878-x},
abstract ={Background: Caenorhabditis elegans is an excellent research model whose populations have been used in many studies to address various biological questions. Although worm-to-worm phenotypic variations in isogenic populations have been persistently observed, they are not well understood and are often ignored or averaged out in studies, masking the impacts of such variations on data collection and interpretation. Single-worm RNA sequencing that profiles the transcriptomes of individual animals has the power to examine differences between individuals in a worm population, but this approach has been understudied. The integrity of the starting RNA, the quality of the library and sequence data, as well as the transcriptome-profiling effectiveness of single-worm RNA-seq remain unclear. Therefore, more studies are needed to improve this technique and its application in research. Results: In this study, we aimed to develop a single-worm RNA-seq method that includes five steps: worm lysis and RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, library preparation, sequencing, and sequence data analysis. We found that the mechanical lysis of worms using a Qiagen TissueLyser maintained RNA integrity and determined that the quality of our single-worm libraries was comparable to that of standard RNA-seq libraries based on assessments of a variety of parameters. Furthermore, analysis of pathogen infection-induced gene expression using single-worm RNA-seq identified a core set of genes and biological processes relating to the immune response and metabolism affected by infection. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our single-worm RNA-seq method in transcriptome profiling and its usefulness in addressing biological questions. Conclusions: We have developed a single-worm RNA-seq method to effectively profile gene expression in individual C. elegans and have applied this method to study C. elegans responses to pathogen infection. Key aspects of our single-worm RNA-seq libraries were comparable to those of standard RNA-seq libraries. The single-worm method captured the core set of, but not all, infection-affected genes and biological processes revealed by the standard method, indicating that there was gene regulation that is not shared by all individuals in a population. Our study suggests that combining single-worm and standard RNA-seq approaches will allow for detecting and distinguishing shared and individual-specific gene activities in isogenic populations.},

title ={CemOrange2 fusions facilitate multifluorophore subcellular imaging in C. elegans},
year ={2019},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pone.0214257},
abstract ={Due to its ease of genetic manipulation and transparency, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) has become a preferred model system to study gene function by microscopy. The use of Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to proteins or targeting sequences of interest, further expanded upon the utility of C. elegans by labeling subcellular structures, which enables following their disposition during development or in the presence of genetic mutations. Fluorescent proteins with excitation and emission spectra different from that of GFP accelerated the use of multifluorophore imaging in real time. We have expanded the repertoire of fluorescent proteins for use in C. elegans by developing a codonoptimized version of Orange2 (CemOrange2). Proteins or targeting motifs fused to CemOr-ange2 were distinguishable from the more common fluorophores used in the nematode; such as GFP, YFP, and mKate2. We generated a panel of CemOrange2 fusion constructs, and confirmed they were targeted to their correct subcellular addresses by colocalization with independent markers. To demonstrate the potential usefulness of this new panel of fluorescent protein markers, we showed that CemOrange2 fusion proteins could be used to: 1) monitor biological pathways, 2) multiplex with other fluorescent proteins to determine colocalization and 3) gain phenotypic knowledge of a human ABCA3 orthologue, ABT-4, trafficking variant in the C. elegans model organism.},

abstract ={Abnormal nutrient metabolism is a hallmark of aging, and the underlying genetic and nutritional framework is rapidly being uncovered, particularly using C. elegans as a model. However, the direct metabolic consequences of perturbations in life history of C. elegans remain to be clarified. Based on recent advances in the metabolomics field, we optimized and validated a sensitive mass spectrometry (MS) platform for identification of major metabolite classes in worms and applied it to study age and diet related changes. Using this platform that allowed detection of over 600 metabolites in a sample of 2500 worms, we observed marked changes in fatty acids, amino acids and phospholipids during worm life history, which were independent from the germ-line. Worms underwent a striking shift in lipid metabolism after early adulthood that was at least partly controlled by the metabolic regulator AAK-2/AMPK. Most amino acids peaked during development, except aspartic acid and glycine, which accumulated in aged worms. Dietary intervention also influenced worm metabolite profiles and the regulation was highly specific depending on the metabolite class. Altogether, these MS-based methods are powerful tools to perform worm metabolomics for aging and metabolism-oriented studies.},

abstract ={Nuclei adjust their deformability while migrating through constrictions to enable structural changes and maintain nuclear integrity. The effect of heterochromatin anchored at the nucleoplasmic face of the inner nuclear membrane on nuclear morphology and deformability during in vivo nuclear migration through constricted spaces remains unclear. Here, we show that abolishing peripheral heterochromatin anchorage by eliminating CEC-4, a chromodomain protein that tethers H3K9-methylated chromatin to the nuclear periphery, disrupts constrained P-cell nuclear migration in Caenorhabditis elegans larvae in the absence of the established LINC complex-dependent pathway. CEC-4 acts in parallel to an actin and CDC-42-based pathway. We also demonstrate the necessity for the chromatin methyltransferases MET-2 and JMJD-1.2 during P-cell nuclear migration in the absence of functional LINC complexes. We conclude that H3K9nethylated chromatin needs to be anchored to the nucleoplasmic face of the inner nuclear membrane to help facilitate nuclear migration through constricted spaces in vivo.},

doi ={10.1016/j.chom.2012.02.008},
abstract ={Pathogens commonly disrupt host cell processes or cause damage, but the surveillance mechanisms used by animals to monitor these attacks are poorly understood. Upon infection with pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the nematode C. elegans upregulates infection response gene irg-1 using the zip-2 bZIP transcription factor. Here we show that P. aeruginosa infection inhibits mRNA translation in the intestine via the endocytosed translation inhibitor Exotoxin A, which leads to an increase in ZIP-2 protein levels. In the absence of infection we find that the zip-2/irg-1 pathway is upregulated following disruption of several core host processes, including inhibition of mRNA translation. ZIP-2 induction is conferred by a conserved upstream open reading frame in zip-2 that could de-repress ZIP-2 translation upon infection. Thus, translational inhibition, a common pathogenic strategy, can trigger activation of an immune surveillance pathway to provide host defense.},

title ={A reversible mitochondrial complex I thiol switch mediates hypoxic avoidance behavior in C. elegans},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-022-30169-y},
abstract ={C. elegans react to metabolic distress caused by mismatches in oxygen and energy status via distinct behavioral responses. At the molecular level, these responses are coordinated by under-characterized, redox-sensitive processes, thought to initiate in mitochondria. Complex I of the electron transport chain is a major site of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and is canonically associated with oxidative damage following hypoxic exposure. Here, we use a combination of optogenetics and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to exert spatiotemporal control over ROS production. We demonstrate a photo-locomotory remodeling of avoidance behavior by local ROS production due to the reversible oxidation of a single thiol on the complex I subunit NDUF-2.1. Reversible thiol oxidation at this site is necessary and sufficient for the behavioral response to hypoxia, does not respond to ROS produced at more distal sites, and protects against lethal hypoxic exposure. Molecular modeling suggests that oxidation at this thiol residue alters the ability for NDUF-2.1 to coordinate electron transfer to coenzyme Q by destabilizing the Q-binding pocket, causing decreased complex I activity. Overall, site-specific ROS production regulates behavioral responses and these findings provide a mechanistic target to suppress the detrimental effects of hypoxia.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102343},
abstract ={Edited by Elizabeth Coulson Proximity-dependent protein labeling provides a powerful in vivo strategy to characterize the interactomes of specific proteins. We previously optimized a proximity labeling protocol for Caenorhabditis elegans using the highly active biotin ligase TurboID. A significant constraint on the sensitivity of TurboID is the presence of abundant endogenously biotinylated proteins that take up bandwidth in the mass spectrometer, notably carboxylases that use biotin as a cofactor. In C. elegans, these comprise POD-2/acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, PCCA-1/propionyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, PYC-1/ pyruvate carboxylase, and MCCC-1/methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase alpha. Here, we developed ways to remove these carboxylases prior to streptavidin purification and mass spectrometry by engineering their corresponding genes to add a Cterminal His 10 tag. This allows us to deplete them from C. elegans lysates using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. To demonstrate the method's efficacy, we use it to expand the interactome map of the presynaptic active zone protein ELKS-1. We identify many known active zone proteins, including UNC-10/RIM, SYD-2/liprin-alpha, SAD-1/BRSK1, CLA-1/CLArinet, C16E9.2/Sentryn, as well as previously uncharacterized potentially synaptic proteins such as the ortholog of human angiomotin, F59C12.3 and the uncharacterized protein R148.3. Our approach provides a quick and inexpensive solution to a common contaminant problem in biotin-dependent proximity labeling. The approach may be applicable to other model organisms and will enable deeper and more complete analysis of interactors for proteins of interest.},

abstract ={Methionine is an essential amino acid, involved in the promotion of growth, immunity, and regulation of energy metabolism. Over the decades, research has long focused on the beneficial effects of methionine supplementation, while data on positive effects of methionine restriction (MR) were first published in 1993. MR is a lowmethionine dietary intervention that has been reported to ameliorate aging and aging-related health concomitants and diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cognitive disorders. In addition, MR seems to be an approach to prolong lifespan which has been validated extensively in various animal models, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, yeast, and murine models. MR appears to be associated with a reduction in oxidative stress via so far mainly undiscovered mechanisms, and these changes in redox status appear to be one of the underlying mechanisms for lifespan extension and beneficial health effects. In the present review, the association of methionine metabolism pathways with redox homeostasis is described. In addition, the effects of MR on lifespan, age-related implications, comorbidities, and diseases are discussed.},

year ={2010},
doi ={10.1111/j.1474-9726.2010.00571.x},
abstract ={In Caenorhabditis elegans, longevity is increased by a partial loss-of-function mutation in the mitochondrial complex III subunit gene isp-1. Longevity is also increased by RNAi against the expression of a variety of mitochondrial respiratory chain genes, including isp-1, but it is unknown whether the isp-1(qm150) mutation and the RNAi treatments trigger the same underlying mechanisms of longevity. We have identified nuo-6(qm200), a mutation in a conserved subunit of mitochondrial complex I (NUDFB4). The mutation reduces the function of complex I and, like isp-1(qm150), results in low oxygen consumption, slow growth, slow behavior, and increased lifespan. We have compared the phenotypes of nuo-6(qm200) to those of nuo-6(RNAi) and found them to be distinct in crucial ways, including patterns of growth and fertility, behavioral rates, oxygen consumption, ATP levels, autophagy, and resistance to paraquat, as well as expression of superoxide dismutases, mitochondrial heat-shock proteins, and other gene expression markers. RNAi treatments appear to generate a stress and autophagy response, while the genomic mutation alters electron transport and reactive oxygen species metabolism. For many phenotypes, we also compared isp-1(qm150) to isp-1(RNAi) and found the same pattern of differences. Most importantly, we found that, while the lifespan of nuo-6, isp-1 double mutants is not greater than that of the single mutants, the lifespan increase induced by nuo-6(RNAi) is fully additive to that induced by isp-1(qm150), and the increase induced by isp-1(RNAi) is fully additive to that induced by nuo-6(qm200).

year ={2020},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-020-18501-w},
abstract ={The ability to detect, respond and adapt to mitochondrial stress ensures the development and survival of organisms. Caenorhabditis elegans responds to mitochondrial stress by activating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR mt) to buffer the mitochondrial folding environment, rewire the metabolic state, and promote innate immunity and lifespan extension. Here we show that HDA-1, the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian histone deacetylase (HDAC) is required for mitochondrial stress-mediated activation of UPR mt. HDA-1 interacts and coordinates with the genome organizer DVE-1 to induce the transcription of a broad spectrum of UPR mt , innate immune response and metabolic reprogramming genes. In rhesus monkey and human tissues, HDAC1/2 transcript levels correlate with the expression of UPR mt genes. Knocking down or pharmacological inhibition of HDAC1/2 disrupts the activation of the UPR mt and the mitochondrial network in mammalian cells. Our results underscore an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of HDAC1/2 in modulating mitochondrial homeostasis and regulating longevity.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1093/genetics/iyac068},
abstract ={Light microscopes are the cell and developmental biologists' "best friend," providing a means to see structures and follow dynamics from the protein to the organism level. A huge advantage of Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism is its transparency, which coupled with its small size means that nearly every biological process can be observed and measured with the appropriate probe and light microscope. Continuous improvement in microscope technologies along with novel genome editing techniques to create transgenic probes have facilitated the development and implementation of a dizzying array of methods for imaging worm embryos, larvae, and adults. In this review, we provide an overview of the molecular and cellular processes that can be visualized in living worms using light microscopy. A partial inventory of fluorescent probes and techniques successfully used in worms to image the dynamics of cells, organelles, DNA, and protein localization and activity is followed by a practical guide to choosing between various imaging modalities, including widefield, confocal, lightsheet, and structured illumination microscopy. Finally, we discuss the available tools and approaches, including machine learning, for quantitative image analysis tasks, such as colocalization, segmentation, object tracking, and lineage tracing. Hopefully, this review will inspire worm researchers who have not yet imaged their worms to begin, and push those who are imaging to go faster, finer, and longer.},

abstract ={Histone acetylation and RNA polymerase II phosphorylation are associated with transcriptionally active chromatin, but their spatiotemporal relationship in live cells remains poorly understood. To address this problem, we combine Fab-based labeling of endogenous protein modifications with single-molecule tracking to quantify the dynamics of chromatin enriched with histone H3 lysine-27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and RNA polymerase II serine-5 phosphorylation (RNAP2-Ser5ph). Our analysis reveals that chromatin enriched with these two modifications is generally separate. In these separated sites, we show that the two modifications are inversely correlated with one another on the minutes time scale and that single nucleosomes within each region display distinct and opposing dynamics on the subsecond time scale. While nucleosomes diffuse ~15% faster in chromatin enriched with H3K27ac, they diffuse ~15% slower in chromatin enriched with RNAP2-Ser5ph. These results argue that high levels of H3K27ac and RNAP2-Ser5ph are not often present together at the same place and time, but rather each marks distinct transcriptionally poised or active sites, respectively.},

When mixed with their food, E. coli bacteria, Nile red, and BODIPY-labeled fatty acids stain multiple spherical cellular structures in the C. elegans major fat storage organ, the intestine. However, here we demonstrate that, in the conditions previously reported, the lysosome-related organelles stained by Nile red and BODIPY-labeled fatty acids are not the C. elegans major fat storage compartment. We show that the major fat stores are contained in a distinct cellular compartment that is not stained by Nile red. Using biochemical assays, we validate oil red O staining as a method to assess major fat stores in C. elegans, allowing for efficient and accurate genetic and functional genomic screens for genes that control fat accumulation at the organismal level.},

year ={2017},
doi ={10.1038/ncomms14337},
abstract ={Stress-response pathways have evolved to maintain cellular homeostasis and to ensure the survival of organisms under changing environmental conditions. Whereas severe stress is detrimental, mild stress can be beneficial for health and survival, known as hormesis. Although the universally conserved heat-shock response regulated by transcription factor HSF-1 has been implicated as an effector mechanism, the role and possible interplay with other cellular processes, such as autophagy, remains poorly understood. Here we show that autophagy is induced in multiple tissues of Caenorhabditis elegans following hormetic heat stress or HSF-1 overexpression. Autophagy-related genes are required for the thermoresistance and longevity of animals exposed to hormetic heat shock or HSF-1 overexpression. Hormetic heat shock also reduces the progressive accumulation of PolyQ aggregates in an autophagy-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that autophagy contributes to stress resistance and hormesis, and reveal a requirement for autophagy in HSF-1-regulated functions in the heat-shock response, proteostasis and ageing.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1016/j.jbc.2021.101094},
abstract ={Proximity labeling provides a powerful in vivo tool to characterize the proteome of subcellular structures and the interactome of specific proteins. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is one of the most intensely studied organisms in biology, offering many advantages for biochemistry. Using the highly active biotin ligase TurboID, we optimize here a proximity labeling protocol for C. elegans. An advantage of TurboID is that biotin's high affinity for streptavidin means biotin-labeled proteins can be affinitypurified under harsh denaturing conditions. By combining extensive sonication with aggressive denaturation using SDS and urea, we achieved near-complete solubilization of worm proteins. We then used this protocol to characterize the proteomes of the worm gut, muscle, skin, and nervous system. Neurons are among the smallest C. elegans cells. To probe the method's sensitivity, we expressed TurboID exclusively in the two AFD neurons and showed that the protocol could identify known and previously unknown proteins expressed selectively in AFD. The active zones of synapses are composed of a protein matrix that is difficult to solubilize and purify. To test if our protocol could solubilize active zone proteins, we knocked TurboID into the endogenous elks-1 gene, which encodes a presynaptic active zone protein. We identified many known ELKS-1-interacting active zone proteins, as well as previously uncharacterized synaptic proteins. Versatile vectors and the inherent advantages of using C. elegans, including fast growth and the ability to rapidly make and functionally test knock-ins, make proximity labeling a valuable addition to the armory of this model organism.},

title ={Starvation Responses Throughout the<i>Caenorhabditis</i> <i>elegans</i>Life Cycle},
year ={2020},
doi ={10.1534/genetics.120.303565},
abstract ={Caenorhabditis elegans survives on ephemeral food sources in the wild, and the species has a variety of adaptive responses to starvation. These features of its life history make the worm a powerful model for studying developmental, behavioral, and metabolic starvation responses. Starvation resistance is fundamental to life in the wild, and it is relevant to aging and common diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Worms respond to acute starvation at different times in the life cycle by arresting development and altering gene expression and metabolism. They also anticipate starvation during early larval development, engaging an alternative developmental program resulting in dauer diapause. By arresting development, these responses postpone growth and reproduction until feeding resumes. A common set of signaling pathways mediates systemic regulation of development in each context but with important distinctions. Several aspects of behavior, including feeding, foraging, taxis, egg laying, sleep, and associative learning, are also affected by starvation. A variety of conserved signaling, gene regulatory, and metabolic mechanisms support adaptation to starvation. Early life starvation can have persistent effects on adults and their descendants. With its short generation time, C. elegans is an ideal model for studying maternal provisioning, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, and developmental origins of adult health and disease in humans. This review provides a comprehensive overview of starvation responses throughout the C. elegans life cycle.},

title ={Using population selection and sequencing to characterize natural variation of starvation resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.80204},
abstract ={Starvation resistance is important to disease and fitness, but the genetic basis of its natural variation is unknown. Uncovering the genetic basis of complex, quantitative traits such as starvation resistance is technically challenging. We developed a synthetic-population (re)sequencing approach using molecular inversion probes (MIP-seq) to measure relative fitness during and after larval starvation in Caenorhabditis elegans. We applied this competitive assay to 100 genetically diverse, sequenced, wild strains, revealing natural variation in starvation resistance. We confirmed that the most starvation-resistant strains survive and recover from starvation better than the most starvation-sensitive strains using standard assays. We performed genome-wide association (GWA) with the MIP-seq trait data and identified three quantitative trait loci (QTL) for starvation resistance, and we created near isogenic lines (NILs) to validate the effect of these QTL on the trait. These QTL contain numerous candidate genes including several members of the Insulin/EGF Receptor-L Domain (irld) family. We used genome editing to show that four different irld genes have modest effects on starvation resistance. Natural variants of irld-39 and irld-52 affect starvation resistance, and increased resistance of the irld-39; irld-52 double mutant depends on daf-16/FoxO. DAF-16/ FoxO is a widely conserved transcriptional effector of insulin/IGF signaling (IIS), and these results suggest that IRLD proteins modify IIS, although they may act through other mechanisms as well. This work demonstrates efficacy of using MIP-seq to dissect a complex trait and it suggests that irld genes are natural modifiers of starvation resistance in C. elegans. Editor's evaluation The authors identify natural genetic variants in C. elegans that are associated with variation in starvation resistance. The authors focus on a gene family (irld's) that are thought to regulate insulin signaling. These studies are very interesting in that the approach for identifying natural gene variants is highly innovative and the work provides novel information about this family of genes.},

abstract ={Aging results in a decline of cellular proteostasis capacity which culminates in the accumulation of phototoxic material, causing the onset of age-related maladies and ultimately cell death. Mechanisms that regulate proteostasis such as cellular stress response pathways sense disturbances in the proteome. They are activated to increase the expression of protein quality control components that counteract cellular damage. Utilizing invertebrate model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans, it has become increasingly evident that the regulation of proteostasis and the activation of cellular stress responses is not a cell autonomous process. In animals, stress responses are orchestrated by signals coming from other tissues, including the nervous system, the intestine and the germline that have a profound impact on determining the aging process. Genetic pathways discovered in C. elegans that facilitate cell nonautonomous regulation of stress responses are providing an exciting feeding ground for new interventions. In this review I will discuss cell nonautonomous proteostasis mechanisms and their impact on aging as well as ongoing research and clinical trials that can increase organismal proteostasis to lengthen health-and lifespan.},

title ={The C. elegans anchor cell: A model to elucidate mechanisms underlying invasion through basement membrane},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1016/j.semcdb.2023.07.002},
abstract ={Cell invasion through basement membrane barriers is crucial during many developmental processes and in immune surveillance. Dysregulation of invasion also drives the pathology of numerous human diseases, such as metastasis and inflammatory disorders. Cell invasion involves dynamic interactions between the invading cell, basement membrane, and neighboring tissues. Owing to this complexity, cell invasion is challenging to study in vivo, which has hampered the understanding of mechanisms controlling invasion. Caenorhabditis elegans anchor cell invasion is a powerful in vivo model where subcellular imaging of cell-basement membrane interactions can be combined with genetic, genomic, and single-cell molecular perturbation studies. In this review, we outline insights gained by studying anchor cell invasion, which span transcriptional networks, translational regulation, secretory apparatus expansion, dynamic and adaptable protrusions that breach and clear basement membrane, and a complex, localized metabolic network that fuels invasion. Together, investigation of anchor cell invasion is building a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie invasion, which we expect will ultimately facilitate better therapeutic strategies to control cell invasive activity in human disease.},

doi ={10.15252/embj.2020106434},
abstract ={Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs can regulate gene expression levels by coupling with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In order to elucidate a repertoire of mRNAs regulated by alternative splicing coupled with NMD (AS-NMD) in an organism, we performed long-read RNA sequencing of poly(A) + RNAs from an NMD-deficient mutant strain of Caenorhabditis elegans, and obtained full-length sequences for mRNA isoforms from 259 highconfidence AS-NMD genes. Among them are the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) synthetase (sams) genes sams-3 and sams-4. SAM synthetase activity autoregulates sams gene expression through AS-NMD in a negative feedback loop. We furthermore find that METT-10, the orthologue of human U6 snRNA methyltransferase METTL16, is required for the splicing regulation in vivo, and specifically methylates the invariant AG dinucleotide at the distal 3 0 splice site (3 0 SS) in vitro. Direct RNA sequencing coupled with machine learning confirms m 6 A modification of endogenous sams mRNAs. Overall, these results indicate that homeostasis of SAM synthetase in C. elegans is maintained by alternative splicing regulation through m 6 A modification at the 3 0 SS of the sams genes.},

year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={Transgenic overexpression of collagen col-120 increases the lifespan of C. elegans. However, whether post-developmental enhancement of collagen expression could also increase the lifespan is unknown. Recently, we described a method to induce the expression of a target gene using catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9)-engineered C. elegans via ingestion of bacteria expressing a pair of promoter-specific single guide RNAs (sgRNA). Here, we cloned col-120 promoter-specific sgRNA oligo pair into L4440-Biobrick-sgRNA and fed these bacteria to dCas9::VP64 transgenic C. elegans. We observed a similar percentage of lifespan extension by post-developmentally dCas9-induced expression of col-120, as previously reported through transgenic overexpression of col-120. Consistent with this result is that induction of another previously shown longevity-promoting collagen, col-10, also increased lifespan. Furthermore, we found an enhanced resilience to heat stress and increased expression of hsp-16.2 upon dCas9-activated col-120 expression. Together, these results provide an orthogonal method to validate longevity by enhancing col-120 expression and point towards a potential role of collagen enhancement in thermotolerance.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1101/2022.10.14.512315},
abstract ={The auxin-inducible degradation system has been widely adopted in the C. elegans research community for its ability to empirically control the spatiotemporal expression of target proteins. This system can efficiently degrade auxin-inducible degron (AID)-tagged proteins via the expression of a ligand-activatable At TIR1 protein derived from A. thaliana that adapts target proteins to the endogenous C. elegans proteosome. While broad expression of At TIR1 using strong, ubiquitous promoters can lead to rapid degradation of AID-tagged proteins, cell type-specific expression of At TIR1 using spatially restricted promoters often results in less efficient target protein degradation. To circumvent this limitation, we have developed a FLP/FRT 3-based system that functions to reanimate a dormant, high-powered promoter that can drive sufficient At TIR1expression in a cell type-specific manner. We benchmark the utility of this system by generating a number of tissue specific FLP-ON::TIR1 drivers to reveal genetically separable cell type-specific phenotypes for several target proteins. We also demonstrate that the FLP-ON::TIR1 system is compatible with enhanced degron epitopes. Finally, we provide an expandable toolkit utilizing the basic FLP-ON::TIR1 system that can be adapted to drive optimized At TIR1expression in any tissue or cell type of interest.},

abstract ={The soil-dwelling nematode Caenorhabditis elegans serves as a model system to study innate immunity against microbial pathogens. C. elegans have been collected from around the world, where they, presumably, adapted to regional microbial ecologies. Here we use survival assays and RNA-sequencing to better understand how two isolates from disparate climates respond to pathogenic bacteria. We found that, relative to N2 (originally isolated in Bristol, UK), CB4856 (isolated in Hawaii), was more susceptible to the Gram-positive microbe, Staphylococcus epidermidis, but equally susceptible to Staphylococcus aureus as well as two Gram-negative microbes, Providencia rettgeri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We performed transcriptome analysis of infected worms and found gene-expression profiles were considerably different in an isolate-specific and microbe-specific manner. We performed GO term analysis to categorize differential gene expression in response to S. epidermidis. In N2, genes that encoded detoxification enzymes and extracellular matrix proteins were significantly enriched, while in CB4856, genes that encoded detoxification enzymes, C-type lectins, and lipid metabolism proteins were enriched, suggesting they have different responses to S. epidermidis, despite being the same species. Overall, discerning gene expression signatures in an isolate by pathogen manner can help us to understand the different possibilities for the evolution of immune responses within organisms.},

abstract ={The cellular recycling process of macroautophagy/autophagy is an essential homeostatic system induced by various stresses, but it remains unclear how autophagy contributes to organismal stress resistance. In a recent study, we report that a mild and physiologically beneficial ("hormetic") heat shock as well as overexpression of the heat-shock responsive transcription factor HSF-1 systemically increases autophagy in C. elegans. Accordingly, we found HSF-1-and heat stress-inducible autophagy to be required for C. elegans thermoresistance and longevity. Moreover, a hormetic heat shock or HSF-1 overexpression alleviated PolyQ protein aggregation in an autophagy-dependent manner. Collectively, we demonstrate a critical role for autophagy in C. elegans stress resistance and hormesis, and reveal a requirement for autophagy in HSF-1 regulated functions in the heat-shock response, proteostasis, and aging.},

doi ={10.1038/s42003-022-03589-1},
abstract ={Pathogen recognition and the triggering of host innate immune system are critical to understanding pathogen-host interaction. Cellular surveillance systems have been identified as an important strategy for the identification of microbial infection. In the present study, using Bacillus thuringiensis-Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we found an approach for surveillance systems to sense pathogens. We report that Bacillus thuringiensis Cry5Ba, a typical pore-forming toxin, caused mitochondrial damage and energy imbalance by triggering potassium ion leakage, instead of directly targeting mitochondria. Interestingly, we find C. elegans can monitor intracellular energy status to trigger innate immune responses via AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK), secreting multiple effectors to defend against pathogenic attacks. Our study indicates that the imbalance of energy status is a prevalent side effect of pathogen infection. Furthermore, the AMPK-dependent surveillance system may serve as a practicable strategy for the host to recognize and defense against pathogens.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1093/g3journal/jkac184},
abstract ={Efficient and reproducible transgenesis facilitates and accelerates research using genetic model organisms. Here, we describe a modular safe-harbor transgene insertion (MosTI) for use in Caenorhabditis elegans which improves targeted insertion of single-copy transgenes by homology directed repair and targeted integration of extrachromosomal arrays by nonhomologous end-joining. MosTI allows easy conversion between selection markers at insertion site and a collection of universal targeting vectors with commonly used promoters and fluorophores. Insertions are targeted at three permissive safe-harbor intergenic locations and transgenes are reproducibly expressed in somatic and germ cells. Chromosomal integration is mediated by CRISPR/Cas9, and positive selection is based on a set of split markers (unc-119, hygroR, and gfp) where only animals with chromosomal insertions are rescued, resistant to antibiotics, or fluorescent, respectively. Singlecopy insertion is efficient using either constitutive or heat-shock inducible Cas9 expression (25-75%) and insertions can be generated from a multiplexed injection mix. Extrachromosomal array integration is also efficient (7-44%) at modular safe-harbor transgene insertion landing sites or at the endogenous unc-119 locus. We use short-read sequencing to estimate the plasmid copy numbers for 8 integrated arrays (6-37 copies) and long-read Nanopore sequencing to determine the structure and size (5.4 Mb) of 1 array. Using universal targeting vectors, standardized insertion strains, and optimized protocols, it is possible to construct complex transgenic strains which should facilitate the study of increasingly complex biological problems in C. elegans.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-021-27621-w},
abstract ={Defense against intracellular infection has been extensively studied in vertebrate hosts, but less is known about invertebrate hosts; specifically, the transcription factors that induce defense against intracellular intestinal infection in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans remain understudied. Two different types of intracellular pathogens that naturally infect the C. elegans intestine are the Orsay virus, which is an RNA virus, and microsporidia, which comprise a phylum of fungal pathogens. Despite their molecular differences, these pathogens induce a common host transcriptional response called the intracellular pathogen response (IPR). Here we show that zip-1 is an IPR regulator that functions downstream of all known IPR-activating and regulatory pathways. zip-1 encodes a putative bZIP transcription factor, and we show that zip-1 controls induction of a subset of genes upon IPR activation. ZIP-1 protein is expressed in the nuclei of intestinal cells, and is at least partially required in the intestine to upregulate IPR gene expression. Importantly, zip-1 promotes resistance to infection by the Orsay virus and by microsporidia in intestinal cells. Altogether, our results indicate that zip-1 represents a central hub for triggers of the IPR, and that this transcription factor has a protective function against intracellular pathogen infection in C. elegans.},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.3791/61136},
abstract ={An issue often encountered when acquiring image data from fixed or anesthetized C. elegans is that worms cross and cluster with their neighbors. This problem is aggravated with increasing density of worms and creates challenges for imaging and quantification. We developed a FIJI-based workflow, Worm-align, that can be used to generate single-or multi-channel montages of user-selected, straightened and aligned worms from raw image data of C. elegans. Worm-align is a simple and user-friendly workflow that does not require prior training of either the user or the analysis algorithm. Montages generated with Worm-align can aid the visual inspection of worms, their classification and representation. In addition, the output of Worm-align can be used for subsequent quantification of fluorescence intensity in single worms, either in FIJI directly, or in other image analysis software platforms. We demonstrate this by importing the Worm-align output into Worm_CP, a pipeline that uses the opensource CellProfiler software. CellProfiler's flexibility enables the incorporation of additional modules for high-content screening. As a practical example, we have used the pipeline on two datasets: the first dataset are images of heat shock reporter worms that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the promoter of a heat shock inducible gene hsp-70, and the second dataset are images obtained from fixed worms, stained for fat-stores with a fluorescent dye.},

doi ={10.1111/1462-2920.15730},
abstract ={Research on the Caenorhabditis elegans microbiota only recently started, with little known about how C. elegans acquires its microbiota. Slugs live in the same habitat as C. elegans and are known vectors for the worm. Hence, we wondered how the passage through a slug affects the C. elegans gut microbiota and whether worms can acquire bacteria from the slug. Using fluorescently labelled microbiota and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we evaluated microbiota persistence and acquisition in C. elegans after slug passage. We compared C. elegans gut microbiomes isolated from wild-caught slugs to the microbiomes of worms after experimental slug passage to compare similarities and differences in microbiome composition. We found that microbiota persists in C. elegans while passing the slug gut and that worms simultaneously acquire additional bacteria species from the slug. Although the amplicon sequencing variant (ASV) richness of worms from the experiment did not exceed the richness of worms that naturally occur in slugs, we found a high number of shared ASVs indicating the importance of commonly associated microbiota. We demonstrate that C. elegans can take advantage of its passage through the slug by acquiring new potential microbiota without losing its native microbiota.},

title ={Capsaicinoid-Glucosides of Fresh Hot Pepper Promotes Stress Resistance and Longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.1007/s11130-021-00939-y},
abstract ={In this study, capsaicin-glucoside and dihydro-capsaicin-glucoside derived from fresh hot-red pepper were isolated and identified using UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/PDA. Synchronized worms were treated with capsaicinoid-glucosides (CG), and then lifespan and stress resistance were examined. The 50 µg/ml concentration of CG-intake could effectively protect the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) against stresses factors including oxidation and heat as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby enhancing the survival of CG-treated worms under stress. Enhancing stress resistance in CG-treated worms could be due to the increased expressions of stress-related genes in C. elegans such as daf-16, skn-1 and their downstream target genes (sod-3, hsp-16.2, gst-4 and gcs-1). Lifespan study of different C. elegans strains and RT-PCR showed that the CG-mediated lifespan extension was dependent on DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/Nrf2 transcription factors. The study is a step forward in exploring the stress resistance and anti-aging properties of this beneficial extract. Thus, this study will be useful in formulating remedies for stresses factors and age associated disorders.},

title ={<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>germ granules are present in distinct configurations that differentially associate with RNAi-targeted RNAs},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.05.25.542330},
abstract ={RNA silencing pathways are complex, highly conserved, and perform widespread, critical regulatory roles. In C. elegans germlines, RNA surveillance occurs through a series of perinuclear germ granule compartments-P granules, Z granules, SIMR foci, and Mutator foci-multiple of which form via phase separation and exhibit liquid-like properties. The functions of individual proteins within germ granules are well-studied, but the spatial organization, physical interaction, and coordination of biomolecule exchange between compartments within germ granule "nuage" is less understood. Here we find that key proteins are sufficient for compartment separation, and that the boundary between compartments can be reestablished after perturbation. Using superresolution microscopy, we discover a toroidal P granule morphology which encircles the other germ granule compartments in a consistent exterior-to-interior spatial organization. Combined with findings that nuclear pores primarily interact with P granules, this nuage compartment organization has broad implications for the trajectory of an RNA as it exits the nucleus and enters small RNA pathway compartments. Furthermore, we quantify the stoichiometric relationships between germ granule compartments and RNA to reveal discrete populations of nuage that differentially associate with RNAi-targeted transcripts, possibly suggesting functional differences between nuage configurations. Together, our work creates a more spatially and compositionally accurate model of C. elegans nuage which informs the conceptualization of RNA silencing through different germ granule compartments.},

title ={N6-adenosine methylation of ribosomal RNA affects lipid oxidation and stress resistance},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={During stress, global translation is reduced, but specific transcripts are actively translated. How stress-responsive mRNAs are selectively translated is unknown. We show that METL-5 methylates adenosine 1717 on 18S ribosomal RNA in C. elegans, enhancing selective ribosomal binding and translation of specific mRNAs. One of these mRNAs, CYP-29A3, oxidizes the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid to eicosanoids, key stress signaling molecules. While metl-5-deficient animals grow normally under homeostatic conditions, they are resistant to a variety of stresses. metl-5 mutant worms also show reduced bioactive lipid eicosanoids and dietary supplementation of eicosanoid products of CYP-29A3 restores stress sensitivity of metl-5 mutant worms. Thus, methylation of a specific residue of 18S rRNA by METL-5 selectively enhances translation of cyp-29A3 to increase production of eicosanoids, and blocking this pathway increases stress resistance. This study suggests that ribosome methylation can facilitate selective translation, providing another layer of regulation of the stress response.},

title ={Pseudomonas aeruginosa core metabolism exerts a widespread growth-independent control on virulence},
year ={2020},
doi ={10.1038/s41598-020-66194-4},
abstract ={To assess the role of core metabolism genes in bacterial virulence-independently of their effect on growth-we correlated the genome, the transcriptome and the pathogenicity in flies and mice of 30 fully sequenced Pseudomonas strains. Gene presence correlates robustly with pathogenicity differences among all Pseudomonas species, but not among the P. aeruginosa strains. However, gene expression differences are evident between highly and lowly pathogenic P. aeruginosa strains in multiple virulence factors and a few metabolism genes. Moreover, 16.5%, a noticeable fraction of the core metabolism genes of P. aeruginosa strain PA14 (compared to 8.5% of the non-metabolic genes tested), appear necessary for full virulence when mutated. Most of these virulence-defective core metabolism mutants are compromised in at least one key virulence mechanism independently of auxotrophy. A pathway level analysis of PA14 core metabolism, uncovers beta-oxidation and the biosynthesis of amino-acids, succinate, citramalate, and chorismate to be important for full virulence. Strikingly, the relative expression among P. aeruginosa strains of genes belonging in these metabolic pathways is indicative of their pathogenicity. thus, P. aeruginosa strain-to-strain virulence variation, remains largely obscure at the genome level, but can be dissected at the pathway level via functional transcriptomics of core metabolism. Pseudomonas species include Gram-negative, rod-shaped, facultative anaerobic and polarly flagellated bacteria able to utilize a variety of organic compounds and colonize a wide range of niches 1. Some Pseudomonas species can be pathogenic to humans, animals and plants 1-3. While able to inhabit diverse environments, including soil and water, P. aeruginosa strains are common opportunistic human pathogens. They can also infect multiple model hosts, including insects, plants and mice using a remarkable variety of virulence factors 4-6. In humans, P. aeruginosa causes acute infections in injured, burned and immunocompromised patients and persistent respiratory infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis 7-12. Previous comparative analyses of P. aeruginosa strain-specific genes revealed that different isolates tested share >90% of their gene content irrespective of the source (soil, wound, urinary tract, lung, blood or eyes) or the type of infection they were found to cause 3,13,14. The high virulence of bacterial pathogens is usually attributed to the presence of pathogenicity islands, which are clusters of virulence-related genes often acquired through horizontal gene transfer 15,16. The core genome of the highly virulent P. aeruginosa strain PA14 shares ~90% of its genes (as identical homologues) with the prototypic reference strain PAO1, but PA14 contains extra genes in genomic islands related to survival in diverse environments 17,18. Despite the striking genomic similarity, P. aeruginosa strain-to-strain variation in virulence is vast 17,19,20 and cannot be simply explained by the presence of virulence-related genes residing on pathogenicity islands 3. This comes in contrast with genome decay often described in comparative genomic studies of pathogen adaptation to a host-associated lifestyle 6,21,22. The existence of multiple P. aeruginosa virulence factors and their direct regulators may indicate constant strain evolution at the virulence effector/regulator level or at a hierarchically higher gene network level.

title ={The dynamic effect of genetic variation on the in vivo ER stress transcriptional response in different tissues},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.1093/g3journal/jkac104},
abstract ={The genetic regulation of gene expression varies greatly across tissue-type and individuals and can be strongly influenced by the environment. Many variants, under healthy control conditions, may be silent or even have the opposite effect under diseased stress conditions. This study uses an in vivo mouse model to investigate how the effect of genetic variation changes with cellular stress across different tissues. Endoplasmic reticulum stress occurs when misfolded proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. This triggers the unfolded protein response, a large transcriptional response which attempts to restore homeostasis. This transcriptional response, despite being a conserved, basic cellular process, is highly variable across different genetic backgrounds, making it an ideal system to study the dynamic effects of genetic variation. In this study, we sought to better understand how genetic variation alters expression across tissues, in the presence and absence of endoplasmic reticulum stress. The use of different mouse strains and their F1s allow us to also identify contextspecific cis-and trans-regulatory variation underlying variable transcriptional responses. We found hundreds of genes that respond to endoplasmic reticulum stress in a tissue-and/or genotype-dependent manner. The majority of the regulatory effects we identified were acting in cis-, which in turn, contribute to the variable endoplasmic reticulum stress-and tissue-specific transcriptional response. This study demonstrates the need for incorporating environmental stressors across multiple different tissues in future studies to better elucidate the effect of any particular genetic factor in basic biological pathways, like the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.},

doi ={10.1016/j.arr.2022.101700},
abstract ={Modifications of RNA, collectively called the "epitranscriptome", might provide novel biomarkers and innovative targets for interventions in geroscience but are just beginning to be studied in the context of ageing and stress resistance. RNA modifications modulate gene expression by affecting translation initiation and speed, miRNA binding, RNA stability, and RNA degradation. Nonetheless, the precise underlying molecular mechanisms and physiological consequences of most alterations of the epitranscriptome are still only poorly understood. We here systematically review different types of modifications of rRNA, tRNA and mRNA, the methodology to analyze them, current challenges in the field, and human disease associations. Furthermore, we compiled evidence for a connection between individual enzymes, which install RNA modifications, and lifespan in yeast, worm and fly. We also included resistance to different stressors and competitive fitness as search criteria for genes potentially relevant to ageing. Promising candidates identified by this approach include RCM1/NSUN5, RRP8, and F33A8.4/ ZCCHC4 that introduce base methylations in rRNA, the methyltransferases DNMT2 and TRM9/ALKBH8, as well as factors involved in the thiolation or A to I editing in tRNA, and finally the m 6 A machinery for mRNA.},

Alternation of tRNA modifications directly modulates the structure and function of tRNAs and regulates gene expression. Notably, thermophilic organisms exhibit characteristic tRNA modifications that are dynamically regulated in response to varying growth temperatures, thereby bolstering fitness in extreme environments. Here, we review the history and latest findings regarding the functions and biogenesis of several tRNA modifications that contribute to the cellular thermotolerance of thermophiles.},

abstract ={Inheritance of stable and euploid genomes is a prerequisite for species maintenance. The DNA damage response in germ cells controls the integrity of heritable genomes. Whether and how somatic stress responses impact the quality control of germline genomes has remained unclear. Here, we show that PMK-1/p38-mediated stress signaling in intestinal cells is required for germ cell apoptosis amid ionizing radiation (IR)-induced or meiotic DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in C. elegans. We demonstrate that intestinal PMK-1/ p38 signaling regulates the germ cell death in response to environmental stress. The PMK-1/ p38 target SYSM-1 is secreted from the intestine into the germline to trigger apoptosis of meiotic pachytene cells. Compromised PMK-1/p38 signaling in intestinal cells leads to stressinduced aneuploidy in the consequent generation. Our data suggest that somatic stress surveillance controls heritable genome integrity and euploidy.},

title ={Fatty Acid Oxidation Is an Adaptive Survival Pathway Induced in Prostate Tumors by HSP90 Inhibition},
year ={2020},
doi ={10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-20-0570},
abstract ={◥ HSP90 is a molecular chaperone required for stabilization and activation of hundreds of client proteins, including many known oncoproteins. AUY922 (luminespib), a new-generation HSP90 inhibitor, exhibits potent preclinical efficacy against several cancer types including prostate cancer. However, clinical use of HSP90 inhibitors for prostate cancer has been limited by toxicity and treatment resistance. Here, we aimed to design an effective combinatorial therapeutic regimen that utilizes subtoxic doses of AUY922, by identifying potential survival pathways induced by AUY922 in clinical prostate tumors. We conducted a proteomic analysis of 30 patient-derived explants (PDE) cultured in the absence and presence of AUY922, using quantitative mass spectrometry. AUY922 significantly increased the abundance of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism in the PDEs. Consistent with these findings, AUY922-treated prostate cancer cell lines exhibited increased mitochondrial mass and activated fatty acid metabolism processes. We hypothesized that activation of fatty acid oxidation is a potential adaptive response to AUY922 treatment and that cotargeting this process will sensitize prostate cancer cells to HSP90 inhibition. Combination treatment of AUY922 with a clinical inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, perhexiline, synergistically decreased viability of several prostate cancer cell lines, and had significant efficacy in PDEs. The novel drug combination treatment induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, and attenuated the heat shock response, a known mediator of HSP90 treatment resistance. This combination warrants further preclinical and clinical investigation as a novel strategy to overcome resistance to HSP90 inhibition. Implications: Metabolic pathways induced in tumor cells by therapeutic agents may be critical, but targetable, mediators of treatment resistance.},

abstract ={Thermal plasticity on different time scales, including acclimation/ acclimatization and heat-hardening responsea rapid adjustment for thermal tolerance after non-lethal thermal stress, can interact to improve the resilience of organisms to thermal stress. However, little is known about physiological mechanisms mediating this interaction. To investigate the underpinnings of heat-hardening responses after acclimatization in warm seasons, we measured thermal tolerance plasticity, and compared transcriptomic and metabolomic changes after heat hardening at 33 or 37°C followed by recovery of 3 or 24 h in an intertidal bivalve Sinonovacula constricta. Clams showed explicit heat-hardening responses after acclimatization in a warm season. The higher inducing temperature (37°C) caused less effective heathardening effects than the inducing temperature that was closer to the seasonal maximum temperature (33°C). Metabolomic analysis highlighted the elevated content of glycerophospholipids in all heathardened clams, which may help to maintain the structure and function of the membrane. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) tended to be upregulated after heat hardening at 37°C but not at 33°C, indicating that there was no complete dependency of heat-hardening effects on upregulated HSPs. Enhanced energy metabolism and decreased energy reserves were observed after heat hardening at 37°C, suggesting more energy costs during exposure to a higher inducing temperature, which may restrict heat-hardening effects. These results highlight the mediating role of membrane lipid metabolism, heat shock responses and energy costs in the interaction between heathardening response and seasonal acclimatization, and contribute to the mechanistic understanding of evolutionary change and thermal plasticity during global climate change.},

title ={Transcriptome-wide mRNA condensation precedes stress granule formation and excludes stress-induced transcripts},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.1101/2024.04.15.589678},
abstract ={Stress-induced condensation of mRNA and proteins into stress granules is conserved across eukaryotes, yet the function, formation mechanisms, and relation to well-studied conserved transcriptional responses remain largely unresolved. Stress-induced exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following translational shutoff is thought to cause condensation by allowing new multivalent RNA-dependent interactions, with RNA length and associated interaction capacity driving increased condensation. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNA species condense in response to multiple unrelated stresses in budding yeast, length plays a minor role, and instead, stress-induced transcripts are preferentially excluded from condensates, enabling their selective translation. Using both endogenous genes and reporter constructs, we show that translation initiation blockade, rather than resulting ribosome-free RNA, causes condensation. These translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are biochemically detectable even when stress granules, defined as microscopically visible foci, are absent or blocked. TIICs occur in unstressed yeast cells, and, during stress, grow before the appearance of visible stress granules. Stress-induced transcripts are excluded from TIICs primarily due to the timing of their expression, rather than their sequence features. Together, our results reveal a simple system by which cells redirect translational activity to newly synthesized transcripts during stress, with broad implications for cellular regulation in changing conditions.},

abstract ={Increasing numbers of studies seek to characterize the different cellular sub-populations present in mammalian tissues. The techniques "Isolation of Nuclei Tagged in Specific Cell Types" (INTACT) or "Fluorescence-Activated Nuclei Sorting" (FANS) are frequently used for isolating nuclei of specific cellular subtypes. These nuclei are then used for molecular characterization of the cellular sub-populations. Despite the increasing popularity of both techniques, little is known about their isolation efficiency, advantages, and disadvantages or downstream molecular effects. In our study, we compared the physical and molecular attributes of sfGFP+ nuclei isolated by the two methods-INTACT and FANS-from the neocortices of Arc-CreERT2 × CAG-Sun1/sfGFP animals. We identified differences in efficiency of sfGFP+ nuclei isolation, nuclear size as well as transcriptional (RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) states. Therefore, our study presents a comprehensive comparison between the two widely used nuclei sorting techniques, identifying the advantages and disadvantages for both INTACT and FANS. Our conclusions are summarized in a table to guide researchers in selecting the most suitable methodology for their individual experimental design.},

We have developed a rapid and inexpensive method for detection of point mutants through optimization of SuperSelective (SS) primers for endpoint PCR in Caenorhabditis elegans. Each SS primer consists of a 59 "anchor" that hybridizes to the template, followed by a noncomplementary "bridge," and a "foot" corresponding to the target allele. The foot sequence is short, such that a single mismatch at the terminal 39 nucleotide destabilizes primer binding and prevents extension, enabling discrimination of different alleles. We explored how length and sequence composition of each SS primer segment affected selectivity and efficiency in various genetic contexts in order to develop simple rules for primer design that allow for differentiation between alleles over a broad range of annealing temperatures. Manipulating bridge length affected amplification efficiency, while modifying the foot sequence altered discriminatory power. Changing the anchor position enabled SS primers to be used for genotyping in regions with sequences that are challenging for standard primer design. After defining primer design parameters, we demonstrated the utility of SS primers for genotyping crude C. elegans lysates, suggesting that this approach could also be used for SNP mapping and screening of CRISPR mutants. Further, since SS primers reliably detect point mutations, this method has potential for broad application in all genetic systems.},

abstract ={A decline in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function is believed to underlie hematological shortcomings with age; however, a comprehensive molecular understanding of these changes is currently lacking. Here we provide evidence that a transcriptional signature reported in several previous studies on HSC aging is linked to stress-induced changes in gene expression rather than aging. Our findings have strong implications for the design and interpretation of HSC aging studies.},

abstract ={Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) has been and remains a valuable model organism to study developmental biology, aging, neurobiology, and genetics. The large body of work on C. elegans makes it an ideal candidate to integrate into largepopulation, whole-animal studies to dissect the complex biological components and their relationships with another organism. In order to use C. elegans in collaborativeomics research, a method is needed to generate large populations of animals where a single sample can be split and assayed across diverse platforms for comparative analyses. Here, a method to culture and collect an abundant mixed-stage C. elegans population on a large-scale culture plate (LSCP) and subsequent phenotypic data is presented. This pipeline yields sufficient numbers of animals to collect phenotypic and population data, along with any data needed for-omics experiments (i.e., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics). In addition, the LSCP method requires minimal manipulation to the animals themselves, less user preparation time, provides tight environmental control, and ensures that handling of each sample is consistent throughout the study for overall reproducibility. Lastly, methods to document population size and population distribution of C. elegans life stages in a given LSCP are presented.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.06.12.544586},
abstract ={An essential requirement for the use of fluorescent dyes in biomedicine, molecular biology, biochemistry, biophysics and optical imaging is their (covalent) attachment to biomolecules. There is, however, no systematic and automated approach for the selection of suitable labeling sites in macromolecules, which is particular problematic for proteins. Here, we present a general and quantitative strategy to identify optimal residues for protein labeling using a naïve Bayes classifier. Based on a literature search and bioinformatics analysis of >100 proteins with ~400 successfully labeled residues, we identified four parameters, which we combined into a labeling score to rank residues for their suitability as a label-site. The utility of our approach for the systematic selection of single residues and residue pairs for FRET experiments is supported by data from the literature and by new experiments on different proteins. To make the method available to a large community of researchers, we developed a python package called "labelizer", that performs an analysis of a pdb-structure (or structural models), label score calculation, and FRET assay scoring. We further provide a webserver (https://labelizer.bio.lmu.de/) to conveniently apply our approach and to build up a central open-access database of (non-)successfully labeled protein residues to continuously improve and refine the labelizer approach.},

doi ={10.1038/s41598-022-15417-x},
abstract ={Individual analysis of the epigenome of preimplantation embryos is useful for characterizing each embryo and for investigating the effects of environmental factors on their epigenome. However, it is difficult to analyze genome-wide epigenetic modifications, especially histone modifications, in a large number of single embryos due to the small number of cells and the complexity of the analysis methods. To solve this problem, we further modified the CUT&Tag method, which can analyze histone modifications in a small number of cells, such that the embryo is handled as a cell mass in the reaction solutions in the absence of the solid-phase magnetic beads that are used for antibody and enzyme reactions in the conventional method (NON-TiE-UP CUT&Tag; NTU-CAT). By using bovine blastocysts as a model, we showed that genome-wide profiles of representative histone modifications, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, could be obtained by NTU-CAT that are in overall agreement with the conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) method, even from single embryos. However, this new approach has limitations that require attention, including false positive and negative peaks and lower resolution for broad modifications. Despite these limitations, we consider NTU-CAT a promising replacement for ChIP-seq with the great advantage of being able to analyze individual embryos.},

abstract ={The wide variety of specialized permissive and repressive mechanisms by which germ cells regulate developmental gene expression are not well understood genomewide. Isolation of germ cells with high integrity and purity from living animals is necessary to address these open questions, but no straightforward methods are currently available. Here we present an experimental paradigm that permits the isolation of the nuclei from C. elegans germ cells at quantities sufficient for genomic analyses. We demonstrate that these nuclei represent a very pure population and are suitable for both chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) and transcriptome (RNA-seq) analyses. The method does not require specialized transgenic strains or growth conditions and can be readily adopted by other researchers with minimal troubleshooting. This new capacity removes a major barrier in the field to dissect gene expression mechanisms in the germ line of C. elegans. Consequent discoveries using this technology will be relevant to conserved regulatory mechanisms across species.},

title ={LipidSIM: Inferring mechanistic lipid biosynthesis perturbations from lipidomics with a flexible, low-parameter, Markov modeling framework},
year ={2024},
doi ={10.1016/j.ymben.2024.01.004},
abstract ={Lipid metabolism is a complex and dynamic system involving numerous enzymes at the junction of multiple metabolic pathways. Disruption of these pathways leads to systematic dyslipidemia, a hallmark of many pathological developments, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and diabetes. Recent advances in computational tools can provide insights into the dysregulation of lipid biosynthesis, but limitations remain due to the complexity of lipidomic data, limited knowledge of interactions among involved enzymes, and technical challenges in standardizing across different lipid types. Here, we present a low-parameter, biologically interpretable framework named Lipid Synthesis Investigative Markov model (LipidSIM), which models and predicts the source of perturbations in lipid biosynthesis from lipidomic data. LipidSIM achieves this by accounting for the interdependency between the lipid species via the lipid biosynthesis network and generates testable hypotheses regarding changes in lipid biosynthetic reactions. This feature allows the integration of lipidomics with other omics types, such as transcriptomics, to elucidate the direct driving mechanisms of altered lipidomes due to treatments or disease progression. To demonstrate the value of LipidSIM, we first applied it to hepatic lipidomics following Keap1 knockdown and found that changes in mRNA expression of the lipid pathways were consistent with the LipidSIM-predicted fluxes. Second, we used it to study lipidomic changes following intraperitoneal injection of CCl 4 to induce fast NAFLD/NASH development and the progression of fibrosis and hepatic cancer. Finally, to show the power of LipidSIM for classifying samples with dyslipidemia, we used a Dgat2-knockdown study dataset. Thus, we show that as it demands no a priori knowledge of enzyme kinetics, LipidSIM is a valuable and intuitive framework for extracting biological insights from complex lipidomic data.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1093/genetics/iyac166},
abstract ={Control of gene expression in specific tissues and/or at certain stages of development allows the study and manipulation of gene function with high precision. Site-specific genome recombination by the flippase (FLP) and cyclization recombination (Cre) enzymes has proved particularly relevant. Joint efforts of many research groups have led to the creation of efficient FLP and Cre drivers to regulate gene expression in a variety of tissues in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we extend this toolkit by the addition of FLP lines that drive recombination specifically in distal tip cells, the somatic gonad, coelomocytes, and the epithelial P lineage. In some cases, recombination-mediated gene knockouts do not completely deplete protein levels due to persistence of long-lived proteins. To overcome this, we developed a spatiotemporally regulated degradation system for green fluorescent fusion proteins based on FLP-mediated recombination. Using 2 stable nuclear pore proteins, MEL-28/ELYS and NPP-2/NUP85 as examples, we report the benefit of combining tissue-specific gene knockout and protein degradation to achieve complete protein depletion. We also demonstrate that FLP-mediated recombination can be utilized to identify transcriptomes in a C. elegans tissue of interest. We have adapted RNA polymerase DamID for the FLP toolbox and by focusing on a wellcharacterized tissue, the hypodermis, we show that the vast majority of genes identified by RNA polymerase DamID are known to be expressed in this tissue. These tools allow combining FLP activity for simultaneous gene inactivation and transcriptomic profiling, thus enabling the inquiry of gene function in various complex biological processes.},

year ={2019},
doi ={10.1534/g3.119.400741},
abstract ={The relationship of genotypes to phenotypes can be modified by environmental inputs. Such crucial environmental inputs include metabolic cues derived from microbes living together with animals. Thus, the analysis of genetic effects on animals' physiology can be confounded by variations in the metabolic profile of microbes. Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to distinct bacterial strains and species exhibit phenotypes different at cellular, developmental, and behavioral levels. Here we reported metabolomic profiles of three Escherichia coli strains, B strain OP50, K-12 strain MG1655, and B-K-12 hybrid strain HB101, as well as different mitochondrial and fat storage phenotypes of C. elegans exposed to MG1655 and HB101 vs. OP50. We found that these metabolic phenotypes of C. elegans are not correlated with overall metabolic patterning of bacterial strains, but their specific metabolites. In particular, the fat storage phenotype is traced to the betaine level in different bacterial strains. HT115 is another K-12 E. coli strain that is commonly utilized to elicit an RNA interference response, and we showed that C. elegans exposed to OP50 and HT115 exhibit differences in mitochondrial morphology and fat storage levels. We thus generated an RNA interference competent OP50 (iOP50) strain that can robustly and consistently knockdown endogenous C. elegans genes in different tissues. Together, these studies suggest the importance of specific bacterial metabolites in regulating the host's physiology and provide a tool to prevent confounding effects when analyzing genotype-phenotype interactions under different bacterial backgrounds.},

abstract ={RNA interference (RNAi), mediated by the introduction of a specific double-stranded RNA, is a powerful method to investigate gene function. It is widely used in the Caenorhabditis elegans research community. An expanding number of laboratories conduct genome-wide RNAi screens, using standard libraries of bacterial clones each designed to produce a specific double-stranded RNA. Proper interpretation of results from RNAi experiments requires a series of analytical steps, from the verification of the identity of bacterial clones, to the identification of the clones' potential targets. Despite the popularity of the technique, no user-friendly set of tools allowing these steps to be carried out accurately, automatically, and at a large scale, is currently available. We report here the design and production of Clone Mapper, an online suite of tools specifically adapted to the analysis pipeline typical for RNAi experiments with C. elegans. We show that Clone Mapper overcomes the limitations of existing techniques and provide examples illustrating its potential for the identification of biologically relevant genes.

abstract ={The auxin-inducible degradation system has emerged as a powerful tool to deplete proteins of interest in cells and tissues of various model organisms, including C. elegans 2-5. Here, we present a detailed protocol to perform AID-driven spatiotemporal depletion of specific proteins in C. elegans tissues. First, we introduced the AID degron and a fluorescent reporter at two conserved proteins: (a) the transcription factor CFI-1 (human ARID3), which is expressed in the nucleus of multiple C. elegans neurons and head muscle cells 6,7 , and (b) the broadly expressed translation initiation factor Y47D3A.21 (human DENR) that localizes in the cytoplasm. Second, we provide a step-by-step guide on how to generate C. elegans strains suitable for AIDmediated protein (CFI-1 and DENR) depletion. Third, we find that the degree of CFI-1 and DENR depletion in C. elegans tissues is comparable upon treatment with either natural auxin (indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) or a water-soluble synthetic auxin analog (K-NAA). Last, we compare the degree of AID-mediated CFI-1 depletion in C. elegans neurons when the transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1), component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, is provided in neurons or all somatic cells. Altogether, this protocol provides side-by-side comparisons of different auxins and TIR1-expressing lines. Such comparisons may benefit future studies of AID-mediated protein depletion in C. elegans.},

title ={MorphoFeatures for unsupervised exploration of cell types, tissues, and organs in volume electron microscopy},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.80918},
abstract ={Electron microscopy (EM) provides a uniquely detailed view of cellular morphology, including organelles and fine subcellular ultrastructure. While the acquisition and (semi-)automatic segmentation of multicellular EM volumes are now becoming routine, large-scale analysis remains severely limited by the lack of generally applicable pipelines for automatic extraction of comprehensive morphological descriptors. Here, we present a novel unsupervised method for learning cellular morphology features directly from 3D EM data: a neural network delivers a representation of cells by shape and ultrastructure. Applied to the full volume of an entire three-segmented worm of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii, it yields a visually consistent grouping of cells supported by specific gene expression profiles. Integration of features across spatial neighbours can retrieve tissues and organs, revealing, for example, a detailed organisation of the animal foregut. We envision that the unbiased nature of the proposed morphological descriptors will enable rapid exploration of very different biological questions in large EM volumes, greatly increasing the impact of these invaluable, but costly resources.},

title ={A rapid seamless method for gene knockout in Pseudomonas aeruginosa},
year ={2017},
doi ={10.1186/s12866-017-1112-5},
abstract ={Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a model organism for the study of quorum sensing, biofilm formation, and also leading cause of nosocomial infections in immune compromised patients. As such P. aeruginosa is one of the most well studied organisms in terms of its genetics. However, the construction of gene deletions and replacements in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is relatively time-consuming, requiring multiple steps including suicide vector construction, conjugation, inactivation with insertion of antibiotic resistance cassettes and allelic exchange. Even employing Gateway recombineering techniques with direct transformation requires a minimum two weeks. Methods: We have developed a rapid streamlined method to create clean deletion mutants in P. aeruginosa through direct transformation, eliminating the need for the creation of Gateway-compatible suicide vectors. In this method, upstream and downstream sequences of the gene/locus to be deleted are amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and seamlessly fused with the linearized pEX18Tc sacB suicide plasmid by Gibson assembly. The resulting deletion plasmid is transformed into P. aeruginosa by an electroporation method optimized in this study. The plasmid is then integrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination, and deletion mutants are identified via sacB mediated sucrose counter-selection. Results: The current method was employed to generate clean gene deletions of the heme assimilation system anti-σ factor, hasS and the virulence regulator involving ECF system anti-σ and σ factors vreA and vreI, respectively. The process from plasmid construction to confirmation by DNA sequencing of the gene deletion was completed in one week. Furthermore, the utility of the method is highlighted in the construction of the vreA and vreI deletions, where the start codon of vreA and the stop codon of vreI overlap. Utilizing Gibson assembly deletion mutants were constructed with single base pair precision to generate the respective vreA and vreI deletions, while maintaining the start and stop codon of the respective genes. Overall, this method allows for rapid construction of gene deletions in P. aeruginosa with base pair precision. Conclusion: This method from the construction of the suicide vector to sequence confirmation of the unmarked gene deletion can be performed in one week, without the requirement for expensive proprietary reagents or instruments. The precision of Gibson assembly and the fact the accuracy in generating the desirable construct is 95%, makes this a viable and attractive alternative to previous methods.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1093/genetics/iyad072},
abstract ={I outline a streamlined method to insert large, single-copy transgenes into the Caenorhabditis elegans genome using recombinationmediated cassette exchange (RMCE) that relies solely on drug selection yielding a homozygous fluorescent protein (FP) marked transgene in 3 generations (8 days) at high efficiency (>1 insertion per 2 injected P0 animals). Landing sites for this approach are available on four chromosomes in several configurations which yield lines marked in distinct cell types. An array of vectors permit creating transgenes using a variety of selection methods (HygR, NeoR, PuroR, and unc-119) that yield lines expressing different colored FPs (BFP, GFP, mNG, and Scarlet). Although these transgenes retain a plasmid backbone and a selection marker, the inclusion of these sequences typically does not alter the expression of several cell-specific promoters tested. However, in certain orientations, promoters exhibit crosstalk with adjacent transcription units. In cases where crosstalk is problematic, the loxP-flanked fluorescent marker, plasmid backbone, and hygR gene can be excised by crossing through germline Cre expressing lines also created using this technique. Finally, genetic and molecular reagents designed to facilitate customization of both targeting vectors and landing sites are also described. Together, the rapid RMCE toolbox provides a platform for developing further innovative uses of RMCE to create complex genetically engineered tools.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1093/g3journal/jkad184},
abstract ={Genetic modifiers are variants modulating phenotypic outcomes of a primary detrimental variant. They contribute to rare diseases phenotypic variability, but their identification is challenging. Genetic screening with model organisms is a widely used method for demystifying genetic modifiers. Forward genetics screening followed by whole genome sequencing allows the detection of variants throughout the genome but typically produces thousands of candidate variants making the interpretation and prioritization process very time-consuming and tedious. Despite whole genome sequencing is more time and cost-efficient, usage of computational pipelines specific to modifier identification remains a challenge for biological-experiment-focused laboratories doing research with model organisms. To facilitate a broader implementation of whole genome sequencing in genetic screens, we have developed Model Organism Modifier or MOM, a pipeline as a user-friendly Galaxy workflow. Model Organism Modifier analyses raw short-read whole genome sequencing data and implements tailored filtering to provide a Candidate Variant List short enough to be further manually curated. We provide a detailed tutorial to run the Galaxy workflow Model Organism Modifier and guidelines to manually curate the Candidate Variant Lists. We have tested Model Organism Modifier on published and validated Caenorhabditis elegans modifiers screening datasets. As whole genome sequencing facilitates high-throughput identification of genetic modifiers in model organisms, Model Organism Modifier provides a user-friendly solution to implement the bioinformatics analysis of the short-read datasets in laboratories without expertise or support in Bioinformatics.},

The permeabilization is followed by antibody staining and fluorescent imaging. This protocol can be modified for different fixatives, permeabilizing reagents, or molecular readouts.

abstract ={Proximity labeling with genetically encoded enzymes is widely used to study proteinprotein interactions in cells. However, the resolution and accuracy of proximity labeling methods are limited by a lack of control over the enzymatic labeling process. Here, we present a high spatial and temporal resolution technology that can be activated on demand using light, for high accuracy proximity labeling. Our system, called Light Activated BioID (LAB), is generated by fusing the two halves of the split-TurboID proximity labeling enzyme to the photodimeric proteins CRY2 and CIB1. Using live cell imaging, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and mass spectrometry, we show that upon exposure to blue light, CRY2 and CIB1 dimerize, reconstitute the split-TurboID enzyme, and biotinylate proximate proteins. Turning off the light halts the biotinylation reaction. We validate LAB in different cell types and demonstrate that it can identify known binding partners of proteins while reducing background labeling and false positives.},

title ={Theory and practice of using cell strainers to sort Caenorhabditis elegans by size},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.01.07.523116},
abstract ={The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism widely used in basic, translational, and industrial research. C. elegans development is characterized by five morphologically distinct stages, including four larval stages and the adult stage. Stages differ in a variety of aspects including size, gene expression, physiology, and behavior. Enrichment for a particular developmental stage is often the first step in experimental design. When many hundreds of worms are required, the standard methods of enrichment are to grow a synchronized population of hatchlings for a fixed time, or to sort a mixed population of worms according to size. Current size-sorting methods have higher throughput than synchronization and avoid its use of harsh chemicals. However, these size-sorting methods currently require expensive instrumentation or custom microfluidic devices, both of which are unavailable to the majority C. elegans laboratories. Accordingly, there is a need for inexpensive, accessible sorting strategies. We investigated the use of low-cost, commercially available cell strainers to filter C. elegans by size. We found that the probability of recovery after filtration as a function of body size for cell strainers of three different mesh sizes is well described by logistic functions. Application of these functions to predict filtration outcomes revealed non-ideal properties of filtration of worms by cell strainers that nevertheless enhanced filtration outcomes. Further, we found that serial filtration using a pair of strainers that have different mesh sizes can be used to enrich for particular larval stages with a purity close to that of synchronization, the most widely used enrichment method. Throughput of the cell strainer method, up to 14,000 worms per minute, greatly exceeds that of other enrichment methods. We conclude that size sorting by cell strainers is a useful addition to the array of existing methods for enrichment of particular developmental stages in C. elegans.},

title ={CUT&Tag recovers up to half of ENCODE ChIP-seq peaks},
year ={},
doi ={10.1101/2022.03.30.486382},
abstract ={Techniques for genome-wide epigenetic profiling have been undergoing rapid development toward recovery of high quality data from bulk and single cell samples. DNA-protein interactions have traditionally been profiled via chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq), which has become the gold standard for studying histone modifications or transcription factor binding. Cleavage Under Targets & Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) is a promising new technique, which enables profiling of such interactions in situ at high sensitivity and is adaptable to single cell applications. However thorough evaluation and benchmarking against established ChIP-seq datasets are still lacking. Here we comprehensively benchmarked CUT&Tag for H3K27ac and H3K27me3 against published ChIP-seq profiles from ENCODE in K562 cells. Across a total of 30 new and 6 published CUT&Tag datasets we found that no experiment recovers more than 50% of known ENCODE peaks, regardless of the histone mark. We tested peak callers MACS2 and SEACR, identifying optimal peak calling parameters. Balancing both precision and recall of known ENCODE peaks, SEACR without retention of duplicates showed the best performance. We found that reducing PCR cycles during library preparation lowered duplication rates at the expense of ENCODE peak recovery. Despite the moderate ENCODE peak recovery, peaks identified by CUT&Tag represent the strongest ENCODE peaks and show the same functional and biological enrichments as ChIP-seq peaks identified by ENCODE. Our workflow systematically evaluates the merits of methodological adjustments and will facilitate future efforts to apply CUT&Tag in human tissues and single cells.},

A PCR fragment of the gene of interest carrying 5P-and 3P-truncations is cloned into a pKnockout vector, mobilized into P. aeruginosa, and subsequently integrated into the chromosomal copy of the target gene. The orientation of the fragment determines whether (i) the target gene is disrupted without blocking the transcription of downstream genes or (ii) the insertion exerts a polar effect thereby leading to inactivation of a whole operon.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.21769/BioProtoc.4578},
abstract ={Mitochondria are cellular organelles essential for the function and survival of eukaryotic cells. Nearly all mitochondrial proteins are nuclear-encoded and require mitochondrial import upon their synthesis in the cytosol. Various approaches have been described to study mitochondrial protein import, such as monitoring the entry of radiolabeled proteins into purified mitochondria or quantifying newly synthesized proteins within mitochondria by proteomics. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for a commonly used and straightforward assay that quantitatively examines mitochondrial protein import by monitoring the co-localization of mitochondrially targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) with the mitochondrial fluorescence dye MitoTracker TM Deep Red FM by live cell imaging. We describe the preparation and use of a stable mammalian cell line inducibly expressing a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS)-eGFP, followed by quantitative image analysis using an open-source ImageJ-based plugin. This inducible expression system avoids the need for transient transfection while enabling titration of MTS-eGFP expression and thereby avoiding protein folding stress. Overall, the assay provides a simple and robust approach to assess mitochondrial import capacity of cells in various disease-related settings.},

On the basis of machine learning, CEFCIG reveals unique histone codes for transcriptional regulation of reported CIGs, and utilizes these codes to predict CIGs and their master regulators with high accuracy. Applying CEFCIG to 1,005 epigenetic profiles, our analysis uncovers the landscape of regulation network for identity genes in individual cell or tissue types.

doi ={10.1038/s41586-023-06565-9},
abstract ={Lysine residues in histones and other proteins can be modified by post-translational modifications that encode regulatory information 1. Lysine acetylation and methylation are especially important for regulating chromatin and gene expression 2-4. Pathways involving these post-translational modifications are targets for clinically approved therapeutics to treat human diseases. Lysine methylation and acetylation are generally assumed to be mutually exclusive at the same residue. Here we report cellular lysine residues that are both methylated and acetylated on the same side chain to form N ε-acetyl-N ε-methyllysine (Kacme). We show that Kacme is found on histone H4 (H4Kacme) across a range of species and across mammalian tissues. Kacme is associated with marks of active chromatin, increased transcriptional initiation and is regulated in response to biological signals. H4Kacme can be installed by enzymatic acetylation of monomethyllysine peptides and is resistant to deacetylation by some HDACs in vitro. Kacme can be bound by chromatin proteins that recognize modified lysine residues, as we demonstrate with the crystal structure of acetyllysinebinding protein BRD2 bound to a histone H4Kacme peptide. These results establish Kacme as a cellular post-translational modification with the potential to encode information distinct from methylation and acetylation alone and demonstrate that Kacme has all the hallmarks of a post-translational modification with fundamental importance to chromatin biology.},

title ={The Influence of Bacterial Diet on Fat Storage in C. elegans},
year ={2009},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pone.0007545.g001},
abstract ={Background: The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as an important model for studies of the regulation of fat storage. C. elegans feed on bacteria, and various strains of E. coli are commonly used in research settings. However, it is not known whether particular bacterial diets affect fat storage and metabolism. Methodology/Principal Findings: Fat staining of fixed nematodes, as well as biochemical analysis of lipid classes, revealed considerable differences in fat stores in C. elegans growing on four different E. coli strains. Fatty acid composition and carbohydrate levels differ in the E. coli strains examined in these studies, however these nutrient differences did not appear to have a causative effect on fat storage levels in worms. Analysis of C. elegans strains carrying mutations disrupting neuroendocrine and other fat-regulatory pathways demonstrated that the intensity of Nile Red staining of live worms does not correlate well with biochemical methods of fat quantification. Several neuroendocrine pathway mutants and eating defective mutants show higher or lower fat storage levels than wild type, however, these mutants still show differences in fat stores when grown on different bacterial strains. Of all the mutants tested, only pept-1 mutants, which lack a functional intestinal peptide transporter, fail to show differential fat stores. Furthermore, fatty acid analysis of triacylglycerol stores reveals an inverse correlation between total fat stores and the levels of 15-methylpalmitic acid, derived from leucine catabolism. Conclusions: These studies demonstrate that nutritional cues perceived in the intestine regulate fat storage levels independently of neuroendocrine cues. The involvement of peptide transport and the accumulation of a fatty acid product derived from an amino acid suggest that specific peptides or amino acids may provide nutritional signals regulating fat metabolism and fat storage levels.},

title ={Predicted functional interactome of Caenorhabditis elegans and a web tool for the functional interpretation of differentially expressed genes},
year ={2020},
doi ={10.1186/s13062-020-00271-6},
abstract ={Background: The nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, is a saprophytic species that has been emerging as a standard model organism since the early 1960s. This species is useful in numerous fields, including developmental biology, neurobiology, and ageing. A high-quality comprehensive molecular interaction network is needed to facilitate molecular mechanism studies in C. elegans. Results: We present the predicted functional interactome of Caenorhabditis elegans (FIC), which integrates functional association data from 10 public databases to infer functional gene interactions on diverse functional perspectives. In this work, FIC includes 108,550 putative functional associations with balanced sensitivity and specificity, which are expected to cover 21.42% of all C. elegans protein interactions, and 29.25% of these associations may represent protein interactions. Based on FIC, we developed a gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) web tool to interpret potential functional impacts from a set of differentially expressed genes observed in transcriptome analyses. Conclusion: We present the predicted C. elegans interactome database FIC, which is a high-quality database of predicted functional interactions among genes. The functional interactions in FIC serve as a good reference interactome for GSLA to annotate differentially expressed genes for their potential functional impacts. In a case study, the FIC/GSLA system shows more comprehensive and concise annotations compared to other widely used gene set annotation tools, including PANTHER and DAVID. FIC and its associated GSLA are available at the website http://worm.biomedtzc.cn.},

title ={Unifying the known and unknown microbial coding sequence space},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.67667},
abstract ={Genes of unknown function are among the biggest challenges in molecular biology, especially in microbial systems, where 40-60% of the predicted genes are unknown. Despite previous attempts, systematic approaches to include the unknown fraction into analytical workflows are still lacking. Here, we present a conceptual framework, its translation into the computational workflow AGNOSTOS and a demonstration on how we can bridge the known-unknown gap in genomes and metagenomes. By analyzing 415,971,742 genes predicted from 1749 metagenomes and 28,941 bacterial and archaeal genomes, we quantify the extent of the unknown fraction, its diversity, and its relevance across multiple organisms and environments. The unknown sequence space is exceptionally diverse, phylogenetically more conserved than the known fraction and predominantly taxonomically restricted at the species level. From the 71 M genes identified to be of unknown function, we compiled a collection of 283,874 lineage-specific genes of unknown function for Cand. Patescibacteria (also known as Candidate Phyla Radiation, CPR), which provides a significant resource to expand our understanding of their unusual biology. Finally, by identifying a target},

title ={Broad functional profiling of fission yeast proteins using phenomics and machine learning},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.88229},
abstract ={Many proteins remain poorly characterized even in well-studied organisms, presenting a bottleneck for research. We applied phenomics and machine-learning approaches with Schizosaccharomyces pombe for broad cues on protein functions. We assayed colony-growth phenotypes to measure the fitness of deletion mutants for 3509 non-essential genes in 131 conditions with different nutrients, drugs, and stresses. These analyses exposed phenotypes for 3492 mutants, including 124 mutants of 'priority unstudied' proteins conserved in humans, providing varied functional clues. For example, over 900 proteins were newly implicated in the resistance to oxidative stress. Phenotypecorrelation networks suggested roles for poorly characterized proteins through 'guilt by association' with known proteins. For complementary functional insights, we predicted Gene Ontology (GO) terms using machine learning methods exploiting protein-network and protein-homology data (NET-FF). We obtained 56,594 high-scoring GO predictions, of which 22,060 also featured high information content. Our phenotype-correlation data and NET-FF predictions showed a strong concordance with existing PomBase GO annotations and protein networks, with integrated analyses revealing 1675 novel GO predictions for 783 genes, including 47 predictions for 23 priority unstudied proteins. Experimental validation identified new proteins involved in cellular aging, showing that these predictions and phenomics data provide a rich resource to uncover new protein functions. eLife assessment This important study combines extensive phenotyping of genome-wide deletion mutants and machine learning-based prediction to generate a large scale resource for understanding the functions of thousands of fission yeast protein-coding genes. This resource is supported by convincing phenotyping data and state-of-the-art bioinformatic analyses and will be of interest to many geneticists.},

These included novel subunits and assemblies unique to nematodes that we validated using orthogonal methods.

title ={Gene function prediction in five model eukaryotes exclusively based on gene relative location through machine learning},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.1038/s41598-022-15329-w},
abstract ={The function of most genes is unknown. The best results in automated function prediction are obtained with machine learning-based methods that combine multiple data sources, typically sequence derived features, protein structure and interaction data. Even though there is ample evidence showing that a gene's function is not independent of its location, the few available examples of gene function prediction based on gene location rely on sequence identity between genes of different organisms and are thus subjected to the limitations of the relationship between sequence and function. Here we predict thousands of gene functions in five model eukaryotes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens) using machine learning models exclusively trained with features derived from the location of genes in the genomes to which they belong. Our aim was not to obtain the best performing method to automated function prediction but to explore the extent to which a gene's location can predict its function in eukaryotes. We found that our models outperform BLAST when predicting terms from Biological Process and Cellular Component Ontologies, showing that, at least in some cases, gene location alone can be more useful than sequence to infer gene function. We witness a growing gap between the number of assembled genomes and the number of genes with known functions. Less than 1% of the protein sequences in UniProtKB 1 have an experimental Gene Ontology annotation 2 and even in well studied organisms, the majority of known genes have yet no assigned function 3. Furthermore, well studied genes have frequently been assigned more than one function, so less studied genes, for which only one function is known, have probably more functions to be discovered 4. In this context there is an increasing need to improve automated function prediction (AFP) 5-9. The Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation algorithms (CAFA) is a series of experiments designed to provide a large-scale assessment of computational methods dedicated to automated function prediction (AFP) 7,10,11. In all CAFA editions so far, the best results were obtained with machine learning-based methods and combining multiple data sources, typically including sequence derived features, protein structure and molecular interaction data. The performance of the methods evaluated by the CAFA challenges improved dramatically between the first (2013) and the second (2016) edition, but this improvement slowed down between the second and the third edition (2019). The authors hypothesized that including more varied sources of data will lead to additional large improvements in AFP 7. Thus, finding new ways to extract relevant biological information from the available data is key to improve AFP. For around 99% of all known proteins, the only available information is the sequence encoded in the corresponding genome, highlighting the importance of sequence-based AFP 12. But AFP based on sequence similarity is hindered by a highly variable correlation between sequence identity and gene function 13 and by the evolutionary distance of many genomes to the closest well-characterized genome 14. Here we explore the hypothesis that the location of a gene relative to other annotated genes of the same genome, a feature that is independent of},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1007/s11010-023-04827-8},
abstract ={The ever-increasing availability of genome sequencing data has revealed a substantial number of uncharacterized genes without known functions across various organisms. The first comprehensive genome sequencing of E. coli K12 revealed that more than 50% of its open reading frames corresponded to transcripts with no known functions. The group of proteincoding genes without a functional description and/or a recognized pathway, beginning with the letter "Y", is classified as the "y-ome". Several efforts have been made to elucidate the functions of these genes and to recognize their role in biological processes. This review provides a brief update on various strategies employed when studying the y-ome, such as high-throughput experimental approaches, comparative omics, metabolic engineering, gene expression analysis, and data integration techniques. Additionally, we highlight recent advancements in functional annotation methods, including the use of machine learning, network analysis, and functional genomics approaches. Novel approaches are required to produce more precise functional annotations across the genome to reduce the number of genes with unknown functions.},

abstract ={We compare whole-animal RNA-seq transcriptomes for C. elegans males and hermaphrodites from the late L3 larval stage to young adulthood. During this interval, male sexual structures develop, including extensive neurogenesis and synaptogenesis that nearly doubles the size of the nervous system. Previous genome-wide expression studies in C. elegans have usually focused on only one sex-the hermaphrodite-and there are a relatively large number of genes that remain without meaningful annotation. In the present study, differential expression analysis of the RNAseq data revealed 1,751 genes expressed at a higher level in the male. By differential expression and co-expression analyses, we identified transcription factors required for differentiation of male genital structures, semen proteins, and candidates for components of synapse function. Comparison with other prediction tools suggests that our dataset can expand gene predictions. The results validate the dataset as a rich resource for future gene discovery in C. elegans. In Brief Taking advantage of a unique developmental feature of C. elegans males, Kim et al. compare transcriptomes of the two sexes to identify male-specific and nervous-system-enriched genes. The dataset and mining methods used provide a rich resource for future gene discovery.},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.3389/fgene.2020.00400},
abstract ={Annotating the functional properties of gene products, i.e., RNAs and proteins, is a fundamental task in biology. The Gene Ontology database (GO) was developed to systematically describe the functional properties of gene products across species, and to facilitate the computational prediction of gene function. As GO is routinely updated, it serves as the gold standard and main knowledge source in functional genomics. Many gene function prediction methods making use of GO have been proposed. But no literature review has summarized these methods and the possibilities for future efforts from the perspective of GO. To bridge this gap, we review the existing methods with an emphasis on recent solutions. First, we introduce the conventions of GO and the widely adopted evaluation metrics for gene function prediction. Next, we summarize current methods of gene function prediction that apply GO in different ways, such as using hierarchical or flat interrelationships between GO terms, compressing massive GO terms and quantifying semantic similarities. Although many efforts have improved performance by harnessing GO, we conclude that there remain many largely overlooked but important topics for future research.},

title ={Big Data in<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>:<i>quo vadis</i>?},
year ={2015},
doi ={10.1091/mbc.E15-05-0312},
abstract ={A clear definition of what constitutes "Big Data" is difficult to identify, but we find it most useful to define Big Data as a data collection that is complete. By this criterion, researchers on Caenorhabditis elegans have a long history of collecting Big Data, since the organism was selected with the idea of obtaining a complete biological description and understanding of development. The complete wiring diagram of the nervous system, the complete cell lineage, and the complete genome sequence provide a framework to phrase and test hypotheses. Given this history, it might be surprising that the number of "complete" data sets for this organism is actually rather small-not because of lack of effort, but because most types of biological experiments are not currently amenable to complete large-scale data collection. Many are also not inherently limited, so that it becomes difficult to even define completeness. At present, we only have partial data on mutated genes and their phenotypes, gene expression, and protein-protein interaction-important data for many biological questions. Big Data can point toward unexpected correlations, and these unexpected correlations can lead to novel investigations; however, Big Data cannot establish causation. As a result, there is much excitement about Big Data, but there is also a discussion on just what Big Data contributes to solving a biological problem. Because of its relative simplicity, C. elegans is an ideal test bed to explore this issue and at the same time determine what is necessary to build a multicellular organism from a single cell.},

abstract ={Biomedical research has been previously reported to primarily focus on a minority of all known genes. Here, we demonstrate that these differences in attention can be explained, to a large extent, exclusively from a small set of identifiable chemical, physical, and biological properties of genes. Together with knowledge about homologous genes from model organisms, these features allow us to accurately predict the number of publications on individual human genes, the year of their first report, the levels of funding awarded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the development of drugs against disease-associated genes. By explicitly identifying the reasons for gene-specific bias and performing a meta-analysis of existing computational and experimental knowledge bases, we describe gene-specific strategies for the identification of important but hitherto ignored genes that can open novel directions for future investigation.},

abstract ={Present-day publications on human genes primarily feature genes that already appeared in many publications prior to completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003. These patterns persist despite the subsequent adoption of high-throughput technologies, which routinely identify novel genes associated with biological processes and disease. Although several hypotheses for bias in the selection of genes as research targets have been proposed, their explanatory powers have not yet been compared. Our analysis suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of-omics experiments and the reporting of results. Understudied genes remain abandoned by studies that cite these-omics experiments. Conversely, we find that publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of citations. Among 45 biological and experimental factors previously proposed to affect which genes are being studied, we find that 33 are significantly associated with the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of-omics studies. To promote the investigation of understudied genes we condense our insights into a tool, find my understudied genes (FMUG), that allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits. We demonstrate the utility of FMUG through the identification of genes that remain understudied in vertebrate aging. FMUG is developed in Flutter and is available for download at fmug.amaral.northwestern.edu as a MacOS/Windows app. eLife assessment This study investigated the factors related to understudied genes in biomedical research. It showed that understudied genes are largely abandoned at the writing stage, and it identified a number of biological and experimental factors that influence which genes are selected for investigation. The study is an important contribution to this branch of meta-research, and the evidence in support of the findings is solid.},
