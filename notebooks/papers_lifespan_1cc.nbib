title ={Histone methylation regulates reproductive diapause in Drosophila melanogaster},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1010906},
abstract ={Fluctuating environments threaten fertility and viability. To better match the immediate, local environment, many organisms adopt alternative phenotypic states, a phenomenon called "phenotypic plasticity." Natural populations that predictably encounter fluctuating environments tend to be more plastic than conspecific populations that encounter a constant environment, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity can be adaptive. Despite pervasive evidence of such "adaptive phenotypic plasticity," gene regulatory mechanisms underlying plasticity remains poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that environment-dependent phenotypic plasticity is mediated by epigenetic factors. To test this hypothesis, we exploit the adaptive reproductive arrest of Drosophila melanogaster females, called diapause. Using an inbred line from a natural population with high diapause plasticity, we demonstrate that diapause is determined epigenetically: only a subset of genetically identical individuals enter diapause and this diapause plasticity is epigenetically transmitted for at least three generations. Upon screening a suite of epigenetic marks, we discovered that the active histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K36me1 are depleted in diapausing ovaries. Using ovary-specific knockdown of histone mark writers and erasers, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 and H3K36me1 depletion promotes diapause. Given that diapause is highly polygenic, that is, distinct suites of alleles mediate diapause plasticity across distinct genotypes, we also investigated the potential for genetic variation in diapause-determining epigenetic marks. Specifically, we asked if these histone marks were similarly depleted in diapause of a genotypically distinct line. We found evidence of divergence in both the gene expression program and histone mark abundance. This study reveals chromatin determinants of phenotypic plasticity and suggests that these determinants may be genotype-dependent, offering new insight into how organisms may exploit and evolve epigenetic mechanisms to persist in fluctuating environments.},

abstract ={AU : Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly: Why and how we age are 2 intertwined questions that have fascinated scientists for many decades. However, attempts to answer these questions remain compartmentalized, preventing a comprehensive understanding of the aging process. We argue that the current lack of knowledge about the evolution of aging mechanisms is due to a lack of clarity regarding evolutionary theories of aging that explicitly involve physiological processes: the disposable soma theory (DST) and the developmental theory of aging (DTA). In this Essay, we propose a new hierarchical model linking genes to vital rates, enabling us to critically reevaluate the DST and DTA in terms of their relationship to evolutionary genetic theories of aging (mutation accumulation (MA) and antagonistic pleiotropy (AP)). We also demonstrate how these 2 theories can be incorporated in a unified hierarchical framework. The new framework will help to generate testable hypotheses of how the hallmarks of aging are shaped by natural selection.},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.1534/genetics.120.303565},
abstract ={Caenorhabditis elegans survives on ephemeral food sources in the wild, and the species has a variety of adaptive responses to starvation. These features of its life history make the worm a powerful model for studying developmental, behavioral, and metabolic starvation responses. Starvation resistance is fundamental to life in the wild, and it is relevant to aging and common diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Worms respond to acute starvation at different times in the life cycle by arresting development and altering gene expression and metabolism. They also anticipate starvation during early larval development, engaging an alternative developmental program resulting in dauer diapause. By arresting development, these responses postpone growth and reproduction until feeding resumes. A common set of signaling pathways mediates systemic regulation of development in each context but with important distinctions. Several aspects of behavior, including feeding, foraging, taxis, egg laying, sleep, and associative learning, are also affected by starvation. A variety of conserved signaling, gene regulatory, and metabolic mechanisms support adaptation to starvation. Early life starvation can have persistent effects on adults and their descendants. With its short generation time, C. elegans is an ideal model for studying maternal provisioning, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, and developmental origins of adult health and disease in humans. This review provides a comprehensive overview of starvation responses throughout the C. elegans life cycle.},

title ={Phospholipids undergo hop diffusion in compartmentalized cell membrane},
year ={2002},
doi ={10.1083/jcb.200202050},
abstract ={he diffusion rate of lipids in the cell membrane is reduced by a factor of 5-100 from that in artificial bilayers. This slowing mechanism has puzzled cell biologists for the last 25 yr. Here we address this issue by studying the movement of unsaturated phospholipids in rat kidney fibroblasts at the single molecule level at the temporal resolution of 25 s. The cell membrane was found to be compartmentalized: phospholipids are confined within 230-nm-diameter () compartments for 11 ms on average before hopping to adjacent compartments. These 230-nm compartments exist within greater 750-nm-compartments where these phospholipids are confined for 0.33 s on average. T The diffusion rate within 230-nm compartments is 5.4 m 2 /s, which is nearly as fast as that in large unilamellar vesicles, indicating that the diffusion in the cell membrane is reduced not because diffusion per se is slow, but because the cell membrane is compartmentalized with regard to lateral diffusion of phospholipids. Such compartmentalization depends on the actin-based membrane skeleton, but not on the extracellular matrix, extracellular domains of membrane proteins, or cholesterol-enriched rafts. We propose that various transmembrane proteins anchored to the actinbased membrane skeleton meshwork act as rows of pickets that temporarily confine phospholipids.},

abstract ={Nutrition and metabolism are known to influence chromatin biology and epigenetics through post-translational modifications, yet how this interaction influences genomic architecture and connects to gene expression is unknown. Here we consider, as a model, the metabolicallydriven dynamics of H3K4me3, a histone methylation mark that is known to encode information about active transcription, cell identity, and tumor suppression. We analyze the genome-wide changes in H3K4me3 and gene expression in response to alterations in methionine availability in both normal mouse physiology and human cancer cells. Surprisingly, we find that the location of H3K4me3 peaks is largely preserved under methionine restriction, while the response of H3K4me3 peak width encodes almost all aspects of H3K4me3 biology including changes in expression levels, and the presence of cell identity and cancer-associated genes. These findings may reveal general principles for how nutrient availability modulates specific aspects of chromatin dynamics to mediate biological function.},

title ={PQM-1 controls hypoxic survival via regulation of lipid metabolism},
year ={2020},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-020-18369-w},
abstract ={Animals have evolved responses to low oxygen conditions to ensure their survival. Here, we have identified the C. elegans zinc finger transcription factor PQM-1 as a regulator of the hypoxic stress response. PQM-1 is required for the longevity of insulin signaling mutants, but surprisingly, loss of PQM-1 increases survival under hypoxic conditions. PQM-1 functions as a metabolic regulator by controlling oxygen consumption rates, suppressing hypoxic glycogen levels, and inhibiting the expression of the sorbitol dehydrogenase-1 SODH-1, a crucial sugar metabolism enzyme. PQM-1 promotes hypoxic fat metabolism by maintaining the expression of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase FAT-7, an oxygen consuming, rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid biosynthesis. PQM-1 activity positively regulates fat transport to developing oocytes through vitellogenins under hypoxic conditions, thereby increasing survival rates of arrested progeny during hypoxia. Thus, while pqm-1 mutants increase survival of mothers, ultimately this loss is detrimental to progeny survival. Our data support a model in which PQM-1 controls a trade-off between lipid metabolic activity in the mother and her progeny to promote the survival of the species under hypoxic conditions.},

doi ={10.1038/s41467-022-28469-4},
abstract ={As a major risk factor to human health, obesity presents a massive burden to people and society. Interestingly, the obese status of parents can cause progeny's lipid accumulation through epigenetic inheritance in multiple species. To date, many questions remain as to how lipid accumulation leads to signals that are transmitted across generations. In this study, we establish a nematode model of C. elegans raised on a high-fat diet (HFD) that leads to measurable lipid accumulation, which can transmit the lipid accumulation signal to their multigenerational progeny. Using this model, we find that transcription factors DAF-16/ FOXO and SBP-1/SREBP, nuclear receptors NHR-49 and NHR-80, and delta-9 desaturases (fat-5, fat-6, and fat-7) are required for transgenerational lipid accumulation. Additionally, histone H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks lipid metabolism genes and increases their transcription response to multigenerational obesogenic effects. In summary, this study establishes an interaction between a network of lipid metabolic genes and chromatin modifications, which work together to achieve transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of obesogenic effects.},

title ={<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> establishes germline versus soma by balancing inherited histone methylation},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1242/dev.196600},
abstract ={Formation of a zygote is coupled with extensive epigenetic reprogramming to enable appropriate inheritance of histone methylation and prevent developmental delays. In Caenorhabditis elegans, this reprogramming is mediated by the H3K4me2 demethylase SPR-5 and the H3K9 methyltransferase, MET-2. In contrast, the H3K36 methyltransferase MES-4 maintains H3K36me2/3 at germline genes between generations to facilitate re-establishment of the germline. To determine whether the MES-4 germline inheritance pathway antagonizes spr-5; met-2 reprogramming, we examined the interaction between these two pathways. We found that the developmental delay of spr-5; met-2 mutant progeny is associated with ectopic H3K36me3 and the ectopic expression of MES-4-targeted germline genes in somatic tissues. Furthermore, the developmental delay is dependent upon MES-4 and the H3K4 methyltransferase, SET-2. We propose that MES-4 prevents crucial germline genes from being repressed by antagonizing maternal spr-5; met-2 reprogramming. Thus, the balance of inherited histone modifications is necessary to distinguish germline versus soma and prevent developmental delay.

title ={Beyond Proteostasis: Lipid Metabolism as a New Player in ER Homeostasis},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.3390/metabo11010052},
abstract ={Biological membranes are not only essential barriers that separate cellular and subcellular structures, but also perform other critical functions such as the initiation and propagation of intraand intercellular signals. Each membrane-delineated organelle has a tightly regulated and custommade membrane lipid composition that is critical for its normal function. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) consists of a dynamic membrane network that is required for the synthesis and modification of proteins and lipids. The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen activates an adaptive stress response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR-ER). Interestingly, recent findings show that lipid perturbation is also a direct activator of the UPR-ER, independent of protein misfolding. Here, we review proteostasis-independent UPR-ER activation in the genetically tractable model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. We review the current knowledge on the membrane lipid composition of the ER, its impact on organelle function and UPR-ER activation, and its potential role in human metabolic diseases. Further, we summarize the bi-directional interplay between lipid metabolism and the UPR-ER. We discuss recent progress identifying the different respective mechanisms by which disturbed proteostasis and lipid bilayer stress activate the UPR-ER. Finally, we consider how genetic and metabolic disturbances may disrupt ER homeostasis and activate the UPR and discuss how using-omics-type analyses will lead to more comprehensive insights into these processes.},

title ={Inactivating histone deacetylase HDA promotes longevity by mobilizing trehalose metabolism},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-021-22257-2},
abstract ={Histone acetylations are important epigenetic markers for transcriptional activation in response to metabolic changes and various stresses. Using the high-throughput SEquencing-Based Yeast replicative Lifespan screen method and the yeast knockout collection, we demonstrate that the HDA complex, a class-II histone deacetylase (HDAC), regulates aging through its target of acetylated H3K18 at storage carbohydrate genes. We find that, in addition to longer lifespan, disruption of HDA results in resistance to DNA damage and osmotic stresses. We show that these effects are due to increased promoter H3K18 acetylation and transcriptional activation in the trehalose metabolic pathway in the absence of HDA. Furthermore, we determine that the longevity effect of HDA is independent of the Cyc8-Tup1 repressor complex known to interact with HDA and coordinate transcriptional repression. Silencing the HDA homologs in C. elegans and Drosophila increases their lifespan and delays aging-associated physical declines in adult flies. Hence, we demonstrate that this HDAC controls an evolutionarily conserved longevity pathway.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.3389/fgene.2021.768996},
abstract ={Epigenetic modifications are responsible for finetuning gene expression profiles to the needs of cells, tissues, and organisms. To rapidly respond to environmental changes, the activity of chromatin modifiers critically depends on the concentration of a handful of metabolites that act as substrates and co-factors. In this way, these enzymes act as metabolic sensors that directly link gene expression to metabolic states. Although metabolites can easily diffuse through the nuclear pore, molecular mechanisms must be in place to regulate epigenetic marker deposition in specific nuclear subdomains or even on single loci. In this review, I explore the possible subcellular sites of metabolite production that influence the epigenome. From the relationship between cytoplasmic metabolism and nuclear metabolite deposition, I converse to the description of a compartmentalized nuclear metabolism. Last, I elaborate on the possibility of metabolic enzymes to operate in phase-separated nuclear microdomains formed by multienzyme and chromatin-bound protein complexes.},

doi ={10.7554/eLife.57822},
abstract ={We have previously shown TANGO1 organises membranes at the interface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ERGIC/Golgi (Raote et al., 2018). TANGO1 corrals retrograde membranes at ER exit sites to create an export conduit. Here the retrograde membrane is, in itself, an anterograde carrier. This mode of forward transport necessitates a mechanism to prevent membrane mixing between ER and the retrograde membrane. TANGO1 has an unusual membrane helix organisation, composed of one membrane-spanning helix (TM) and another that penetrates the inner leaflet (IM). We have reconstituted these membrane helices in model membranes and shown that TM and IM together reduce the flow of lipids at a region of defined shape. We have also shown that the helices align TANGO1 around an ER exit site. We suggest this is a mechanism to prevent membrane mixing during TANGO1-mediated transfer of bulky secretory cargos from the ER to the ERGIC/Golgi via a tunnel.},

abstract ={Animals respond to mitochondrial stress with the induction of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR mt). A cascade of events occur upon UPR mt activation, ultimately triggering a transcriptional response governed by two transcription factors: DVE-1 and ATFS-1. Here we identify SUMO-specific peptidase ULP-4 as a positive regulator of C. elegans UPR mt to control SUMOylation status of DVE-1 and ATFS-1. SUMOylation affects these two axes in the transcriptional program of UPR mt with distinct mechanisms: change of DVE-1 subcellular localization vs. change of ATFS-1 stability and activity. Our findings reveal a post-translational modification that promotes immune response and lifespan extension during mitochondrial stress.},

title ={Methionine synthase supports tumor tetrahydrofolate pools},
year ={2020},
doi ={10.1101/2020.09.05.284521},
abstract ={Mammalian cells require activated folates to generate nucleotides for growth and division. The most abundant circulating folate species is 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-THF), which is used to synthesize methionine from homocysteine via the cobalamin-dependent enzyme methionine synthase (MTR). Cobalamin deficiency traps folates as 5-methyl-THF. Here, we show using isotope tracing that methionine synthase is only a minor source of methionine in cell culture, tissues, or xenografted tumors. Instead, methionine synthase is required for cells to avoid folate trapping and assimilate 5-methyl-THF into other folate species. Under conditions of physiological extracellular folates, genetic MTR knockout in tumor cells leads to folate trapping, purine synthesis stalling, nucleotide depletion, and impaired growth in cell culture and as xenografts. These defects are rescued by free folate but not one-carbon unit supplementation. Thus, MTR plays a crucial role in liberating tetrahydrofolate for use in one-carbon metabolism.},

doi ={10.1101/2023.03.09.531951},
abstract ={The declining capacity of cells to maintain a functional proteome is a major driver of cellular dysfunction and decreased fitness in aging. Here we assess the impact of aging on multiple proteome dimensions, which are reflective of function, across the replicative lifespan of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We quantified protein abundance, protein turnover, protein thermal stability, and protein phosphorylation in mother yeast cells and their derived progeny at different ages. We find progressive and cumulative proteomic alterations that are reflective of dysregulation of complex assemblies, mitochondrial remodeling, post-translational activation of the AMPK/Snf1 energy sensor in mother cells, and an overall shift from biosynthetic to energy-metabolic processes. Our multidimensional proteomic study systematically corroborates previous findings of asymmetric segregation and daughter cell rejuvenation, and extends these concepts to protein complexes, protein phosphorylation, and activation of signaling pathways. Lastly, profiling age-dependent proteome changes in a caloric restriction model of yeast provided mechanistic insights into longevity, revealing minimal remodeling of energy-metabolic pathways, improved mitochondrial maintenance, ameliorated protein biogenesis, and decreased stress responses. Taken together, our study provides thousands of age-dependent molecular events that can be used to gain a holistic understanding of mechanisms of aging.},

abstract ={Metabolites affect cell growth in two different ways. First, they serve as building blocks for biomass accumulation. Second, metabolites regulate the activity of growth-relevant signaling pathways. They do so in part by covalently attaching to proteins, thereby generating post-translational modifications (PTMs) that affect protein function, the focus of this Perspective. Recent advances in mass spectrometry have revealed a wide variety of such metabolites, including lipids, amino acids, Coenzyme-A, acetate, malonate, and lactate to name a few. An active area of research is to understand which modifications affect protein function and how they do so. In many cases, the cellular levels of these metabolites affect the stoichiometry of the corresponding PTMs, providing a direct link between cell metabolism and the control of cell signaling, transcription, and cell growth.},

abstract ={Ageing has been defined as a global decline in physiological function depending on both environmental and genetic factors. Here we identify gene transcripts that are similarly regulated during physiological ageing in nematodes, zebrafish and mice. We observe the strongest extension of lifespan when impairing expression of the branched-chain amino acid transferase-1 (bcat-1) gene in C. elegans, which leads to excessive levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). We further show that BCAAs reduce a LET-363/mTOR-dependent neuro-endocrine signal, which we identify as DAF-7/TGFb, and that impacts lifespan depending on its related receptors, DAF-1 and DAF-4, as well as ultimately on DAF-16/FoxO and HSF-1 in a cell-non-autonomous manner. The transcription factor HLH-15 controls and epistatically synergizes with BCAT-1 to modulate physiological ageing. Lastly and consistent with previous findings in rodents, nutritional supplementation of BCAAs extends nematodal lifespan. Taken together, BCAAs act as periphery-derived metabokines that induce a central neuro-endocrine response, culminating in extended healthspan.},

abstract ={Organism aging occurs at the multicellular level; however, how pro-longevity mechanisms slow down aging in different cell types remains unclear. We generated single-cell transcriptomic atlases across the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans under different prolongevity conditions (http://mengwanglab.org/atlas). We found cell-specific, age-related changes across somatic and germ cell types and developed transcriptomic aging clocks for different tissues. These clocks enabled us to determine tissue-specific aging-slowing effects of different pro-longevity mechanisms, and identify major cell types sensitive to these regulations. Additionally, we provided a systemic view of alternative polyadenylation events in different cell types, as well as their cell-type-specific changes during aging and under different pro-longevity conditions. Together, this study provides molecular insights into how aging occurs in different cell types and how they respond to pro-longevity strategies.

abstract ={Aging is associated with a loss of metabolic homeostasis and plasticity, which is causally linked to multiple ageonset pathologies. The majority of the interventions-genetic, dietary, and pharmacological-that have been found to slow aging and protect against age-related disease in various organisms do so by targeting central metabolic pathways. However, targeting metabolic pathways chronically and ubiquitously makes it difficult to define the downstream effects responsible for lifespan extension and often results in negative effects on growth and health, limiting therapeutic potential. Insight into how metabolic signals are relayed between tissues, cells, and organelles opens up new avenues to target metabolic regulators locally rather than globally for healthy aging. In this review, we discuss the pro-longevity effects of targeting metabolic pathways in specific tissues and how these interventions communicate with distal cells to modulate aging. These studies may be crucial in designing interventions that promote longevity without negative health consequences.},

abstract ={Hydrogen peroxide is the preeminent chemical weapon that organisms use for combat. Individual cells rely on conserved defenses to prevent and repair peroxide-induced damage, but whether similar defenses might be coordinated across cells in animals remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a neuronal circuit in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that processes information perceived by two sensory neurons to control the induction of hydrogen peroxide defenses in the organism. We found that catalases produced by Escherichia coli, the nematode's food source, can deplete hydrogen peroxide from the local environment and thereby protect the nematodes. In the presence of E. coli, the nematode's neurons signal via TGFb-insulin/ IGF1 relay to target tissues to repress expression of catalases and other hydrogen peroxide defenses. This adaptive strategy is the first example of a multicellular organism modulating its defenses when it expects to freeload from the protection provided by molecularly orthologous defenses from another species.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-021-24036-5},
abstract ={The mechanism behind transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is unclear, particularly through the maternal grandparental line. We previously showed that disruption of folate metabolism in mice by the Mtrr hypomorphic mutation results in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of congenital malformations. Either maternal grandparent can initiate this phenomenon, which persists for at least four wildtype generations. Here, we use genome-wide approaches to reveal genetic stability in the Mtrr model and genome-wide differential DNA methylation in the germline of Mtrr mutant maternal grandfathers. We observe that, while epigenetic reprogramming occurs, wildtype grandprogeny and great grandprogeny exhibit transcriptional changes that correlate with germline methylation defects. One region encompasses the Hira gene, which is misexpressed in embryos for at least three wildtype generations in a manner that distinguishes Hira transcript expression as a biomarker of maternal phenotypic inheritance.},

abstract ={Ageing is a complex process with common and distinct features across tissues. Unveiling the underlying processes driving ageing in individual tissues is indispensable to decipher the mechanisms of organismal longevity. Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established model organism that has spearheaded ageing research with the discovery of numerous genetic pathways controlling its lifespan. However, it remains challenging to dissect the ageing of worm tissues due to the limited description of tissue pathology and access to tissue-specific molecular changes during ageing. In this study, we isolated cells from five major tissues in young and old worms and profiled the age-induced transcriptomic changes within these tissues. We observed a striking diversity of ageing across tissues and identified different sets of longevity regulators therein. In addition, we found novel tissue-specific factors, including irx-1 and myrf-2, which control the integrity of the intestinal barrier and sarcomere structure during ageing respectively. This study demonstrates the complexity of ageing across worm tissues and highlights the power of tissue-specific transcriptomic profiling during ageing, which can serve as a resource to the field.},

doi ={10.1101/2020.06.12.149005},
abstract ={Targeting folate metabolism can be an effective way to treat cancer. The enzyme methionine synthase catalyzes a key reaction in both folate and methionine metabolism. Early work suggested that inhibiting methionine synthase might restrain tumor growth, though the mechanism remains unclear. We find that due to its specific role in processing folates, methionine synthase is required for cancer proliferation. However, widely used cell culture conditions obscure the proliferative and metabolic consequences of methionine synthase inhibition. Complete dependence on methionine synthase only arises when 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate, the major folate found in circulation, is the predominant folate source provided to cells. In these physiological folate conditions, methionine synthase activity is necessary to maintain intracellular levels of nucleotides, but not methionine. These data reveal that the extracellular environment can alter the essentiality of methionine synthase and suggest that this enzyme plays a crucial cell-autonomous role in supporting nucleotide synthesis and cell proliferation in physiological contexts.},

year ={2020},
doi ={},
abstract ={Aging is the primary driver of various diseases, including common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Currently there is no cure for AD and PD, and the development of novel drug candidates is demanding. Spermidine is a small anti-aging molecule with elimination of damaged mitochondria via the process of mitophagy identified as a molecular mechanism of action. Here, we show that spermidine inhibits memory loss in AD worms and improves behavioral performance, e.g., locomotor capacity, in a PD worm model, both via the PINK1-PDR1-dependent mitophagy pathway. Additionally, spermidine delays accelerated aging and improves healthspan in the DNA repairdeficient premature aging Werner syndrome (WS) worm model. While possible intertwined interactions between mitophagy/autophagy induction and DNA repair by spermidine are to be determined, our data support further translation of spermidine as a possible therapeutic intervention for such diseases.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-022-28201-2},
abstract ={MATα1 catalyzes the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, the principal biological methyl donor. Lower MATα1 activity and mitochondrial dysfunction occur in alcohol-associated liver disease. Besides cytosol and nucleus, MATα1 also targets the mitochondria of hepatocytes to regulate their function. Here, we show that mitochondrial MATα1 is selectively depleted in alcohol-associated liver disease through a mechanism that involves the isomerase PIN1 and the kinase CK2. Alcohol activates CK2, which phosphorylates MATα1 at Ser114 facilitating interaction with PIN1, thereby inhibiting its mitochondrial localization. Blocking PIN1-MATα1 interaction increased mitochondrial MATα1 levels and protected against alcohol-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and fat accumulation. Normally, MATα1 interacts with mitochondrial proteins involved in TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid βoxidation. Preserving mitochondrial MATα1 content correlates with higher methylation and expression of mitochondrial proteins. Our study demonstrates a role of CK2 and PIN1 in reducing mitochondrial MATα1 content leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in alcoholassociated liver disease.},

title ={Glucose restriction drives spatial reorganization of mevalonate metabolism},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.62591},
abstract ={Eukaryotes compartmentalize metabolic pathways into sub-cellular domains, but the role of inter-organelle contacts in organizing metabolic reactions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that in response to acute glucose restriction (AGR) yeast undergo metabolic remodeling of their mevalonate pathway that is spatially coordinated at nucleus-vacuole junctions (NVJs). The NVJ serves as a metabolic platform by selectively retaining HMG-CoA Reductases (HMGCRs), driving mevalonate pathway flux in an Upc2-dependent manner. Both spatial retention of HMGCRs and increased mevalonate pathway flux during AGR is dependent on NVJ tether Nvj1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HMGCRs associate into high-molecular-weight assemblies during AGR in an Nvj1-dependent manner. Loss of Nvj1-mediated HMGCR partitioning can be bypassed by artificially multimerizing HMGCRs, indicating NVJ compartmentalization enhances mevalonate pathway flux by promoting the association of HMGCRs in high molecular weight assemblies. Loss of HMGCR compartmentalization perturbs yeast growth following glucose starvation, indicating it promotes adaptive metabolic remodeling. Collectively, we propose a noncanonical mechanism regulating mevalonate metabolism via the spatial compartmentalization of rate-limiting HMGCR enzymes at an inter-organelle contact site.},

abstract ={The metabolome represents a complex network of biological events that reflects the physiologic state of the organism in health and disease. Additionally, specific metabolites and metabolic signaling pathways have been shown to modulate animal ageing, but whether there are convergent mechanisms uniting these processes remains elusive. Here, we used high resolution mass spectrometry to obtain the metabolomic profiles of canonical longevity pathways in C. elegans to identify metabolites regulating life span. By leveraging the metabolomic profiles across pathways, we found that one carbon metabolism and the folate cycle are pervasively regulated in common. We observed similar changes in long-lived mouse models of reduced insulin/IGF signaling. Genetic manipulation of pathway enzymes and supplementation with one carbon metabolites in C. elegans reveal that regulation of the folate cycle represents a shared causal mechanism of longevity and proteoprotection. Such interventions impact the methionine cycle, and reveal methionine restriction as an underlying mechanism. This comparative approach reveals key metabolic nodes to enhance healthy ageing.},

doi ={10.1016/j.cstres.2024.04.003},
abstract ={Histone H3/H4 chaperone anti-silencing function 1 (ASF1) is a conserved factor mediating nucleosomal assembly and disassembly, playing crucial roles in processes such as replication, transcription, and DNA repair. Nevertheless, its involvement in aging has remained unclear. Here, we utilized the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to demonstrate that the loss of UNC-85, the homolog of ASF1, leads to a shortened lifespan in a multicellular organism. Furthermore, we show that UNC-85 is required for epigenome-mediated longevity, as knockdown of the histone H3 lysine K4 methyltransferase ash-2 does not extend the lifespan of unc-85 mutants. In this context, we found that the longevity-promoting ash-2 RNA interference enhances UNC-85 activity by increasing its nuclear localization. Finally, our data indicate that the loss of UNC-85 increases the activity of one-carbon metabolism, and that downregulation of the one-carbon metabolism component dao-3/MTHFD2 partially rescues the short lifespan of unc-85 mutants. Together, these findings reveal UNC-85/ASF1 as a modulator of the central metabolic pathway and a factor regulating a pro-longevity response, thus shedding light on a mechanism of how nucleosomal maintenance associates with aging.},

abstract ={Transient reprogramming by the expression of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC (OSKM) is a therapeutic strategy for tissue regeneration and rejuvenation, but little is known about its metabolic requirements. Here we show that OSKM reprogramming in mice causes a global depletion of vitamin B 12 and molecular hallmarks of methionine starvation. Supplementation with vitamin B 12 increases the efficiency of reprogramming both in mice and in cultured cells, the latter indicating a cell-intrinsic effect. We show that the epigenetic mark H3K36me3, which prevents illegitimate initiation of transcription outside promoters (cryptic transcription), is sensitive to vitamin B 12 levels, providing evidence for a link between B 12 levels, H3K36 methylation, transcriptional fidelity and efficient reprogramming. Vitamin B 12 supplementation also accelerates tissue repair in a model of ulcerative colitis. We conclude that vitamin B 12 , through its key role in one-carbon metabolism and epigenetic dynamics, improves the efficiency of in vivo reprogramming and tissue repair.},

doi ={10.3389/fragi.2022.860404},
abstract ={Organisms are constantly exposed to stress both from the external environment and internally within the cell. To maintain cellular homeostasis under different environmental and physiological conditions, cell have adapted various stress response signaling pathways, such as the heat shock response (HSR), unfolded protein responses of the mitochondria (UPR MT), and the unfolded protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPR ER). As cells grow older, all cellular stress responses have been shown to deteriorate, which is a major cause for the physiological consequences of aging and the development of numerous age-associated diseases. In contrast, elevated stress responses are often associated with lifespan extension and amelioration of degenerative diseases in different model organisms, including C. elegans. Activating cellular stress response pathways could be considered as an effective intervention to alleviate the burden of aging by restoring function of essential damage-clearing machinery, including the ubiquitin-proteosome system, chaperones, and autophagy. Here, we provide an overview of newly emerging concepts of these stress response pathways in healthy aging and longevity with a focus on the model organism, C. elegans.},

Answering this could reveal new mechanisms of aging and age-targeted therapeutics. In this study, we describe how metabolism changes in 12 organs in male and female mice at 5 different ages. Organs show distinct patterns of metabolic aging that are affected by sex differently. Hydroxyproline shows the most consistent change across the dataset, decreasing with age in 11 out of 12 organs investigated. We also developed a metabolic aging clock that predicts biological age and identified alpha-ketoglutarate, previously shown to extend lifespan in mice, as a key predictor of age. Our results reveal fundamental insights into the aging process and identify new therapeutic targets to maintain organ health.},

abstract ={Physiological homeostasis becomes compromised during ageing, as a result of impairment of cellular processes, including transcription and RNA splicing 1-4. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the loss of transcriptional fidelity are so far elusive, as are ways of preventing it. Here we profiled and analysed genome-wide, ageing-related changes in transcriptional processes across different organisms: nematodes, fruitflies, mice, rats and humans. The average transcriptional elongation speed (RNA polymerase II speed) increased with age in all five species. Along with these changes in elongation speed, we observed changes in splicing, including a reduction of unspliced transcripts and the formation of more circular RNAs. Two lifespan-extending interventions, dietary restriction and lowered insulin-IGF signalling, both reversed most of these ageing-related changes. Genetic variants in RNA polymerase II that reduced its speed in worms 5 and flies 6 increased their lifespan. Similarly, reducing the speed of RNA polymerase II by overexpressing histone components, to counter age-associated changes in nucleosome positioning, also extended lifespan in flies and the division potential of human cells. Our findings uncover fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying animal ageing and lifespan-extending interventions, and point to possible preventive measures.},

abstract ={Methionine adenosyltransferase α1 (MATα1, encoded by MAT1A) is responsible for hepatic biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, the principal methyl donor. MATα1 also act as a transcriptional co-factor by interacting and influencing the activity of several transcription factors. Mat1a knockout (KO) mice have increased levels of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The aims of the current study were to identify binding partners of MATα1 and elucidate how MATα1 regulates CYP2E1 expression. We identified binding partners of MATα1 by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and mass spectrometry. Interacting proteins were confirmed using co-IP using recombinant proteins, liver lysates and mitochondria. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) samples were used to confirm relevance of our findings. We found MATα1 negatively regulates CYP2E1 at mRNA and protein levels, with the latter being the},

title ={HSB-1/HSF-1 pathway modulates histone H4 in mitochondria to control mtDNA transcription and longevity},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={Heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1) is a master regulator of stress responses across taxa. Overexpression of HSF-1 or genetic ablation of its conserved negative regulator, heat shock factor binding protein 1 (HSB-1), results in robust lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we found that increased HSF-1 activity elevates histone H4 levels in somatic tissues during development, while knockdown of H4 completely suppresses HSF-1-mediated longevity. Moreover, overexpression of H4 is sufficient to extend life span. Ablation of HSB-1 induces an H4dependent increase in micrococcal nuclease protection of both nuclear chromatin and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which consequently results in reduced transcription of mtDNA-encoded complex IV genes, decreased respiratory capacity, and a mitochondrial unfolded protein response-dependent lifespan extension. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unknown role of HSB-1/HSF-1 signaling in modulation of mitochondrial function via mediating histone H4-dependent regulation of mtDNA gene expression and concomitantly acting as a determinant of organismal longevity.},

doi ={10.1038/s42003-020-1001-6},
abstract ={Histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) is extensively regulated by numerous writer and eraser enzymes in mammals. Nine H3K4me enzymes are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders to date, indicating their important roles in the brain. However, interplay among H3K4me enzymes during brain development remains largely unknown. Here, we show functional interactions of a writer-eraser duo, KMT2A and KDM5C, which are responsible for Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome (WDSTS), and mental retardation X-linked syndromic Claes-Jensen type (MRXSCJ), respectively. Despite opposite enzymatic activities, the two mouse models deficient for either Kmt2a or Kdm5c shared reduced dendritic spines and increased aggression. Double mutation of Kmt2a and Kdm5c clearly reversed dendritic morphology, key behavioral traits including aggression, and partially corrected altered transcriptomes and H3K4me landscapes. Thus, our study uncovers common yet mutually suppressive aspects of the WDSTS and MRXSCJ models and provides a proof of principle for balancing a single writer-eraser pair to ameliorate their associated disorders.},

doi ={10.1101/2022.06.15.496201},
abstract ={Here we describe a single-cell atlas of aging for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This unique resource describes the expression across adulthood of over 20,000 genes among 211 groups of cells that correspond to virtually every cell type in this organism. Our findings suggest that C. elegans aging is not random and stochastic in nature, but rather characterized by coordinated changes in functionally related metabolic and stress-response genes in a highly cell-type specific fashion. Aging signatures of different cell types are largely different from one another, downregulation of energy metabolism being the only nearly universal change. Some biological pathways, such as genes associated with translation, DNA repair and the ER unfolded protein response, exhibited strong (in some cases opposite) changes in subsets of cell types, but many more were limited to a single cell type. Similarly, the rates at which cells aged, measured as genome-wide expression changes, differed between cell types; some of these differences were tested and validated in vivo by measuring age-dependent changes in mitochondrial morphology. In some, but not all, cell types, aging was characterized by an increase in cell-to-cell variance. Finally, we identified a set of transcription factors whose activities changed coordinately across many cell types with age. This set was strongly enriched for stress-resistance TFs known to influence the rate of aging. We tested other members of this set, and discovered that some, such as GEI-3, likely also regulate the rate of aging. Our dataset can be accessed and queried at c.elegans.aging.atlas.research.calicolabs.com/.},

abstract ={Genetic, environmental and pharmacological interventions into the aging process can confer resistance to a multiple age-related diseases in laboratory animals, including rhesus monkeys. These findings imply that mechanisms of aging might contribute to patterns of multimorbidity in humans, and hence could be targeted to prevent multiple conditions simultaneously. To address this question, we text mined 917,645 literature abstracts followed by manual curation, and found strong, nonrandom associations between age-related diseases and aging mechanisms, confirmed by gene set enrichment analysis of GWAS data. Integration of these associations with clinical data from 3.01 million patients showed that age-related diseases associated with each of five aging mechanisms were more likely than chance to be present together in patients. Genetic evidence revealed that innate and adaptive immunity, the intrinsic apoptotic signalling pathway and activity of the ERK1/2 pathway played a significant role across multiple aging mechanisms and multiple, diverse age-related diseases. Mechanisms of aging therefore contribute to multiple age-related diseases and to patterns of human age-related multimorbidity, and could potentially be targeted to prevent more than one age-related condition in the same patient.},

abstract ={itochondria not only contribute to the harvesting of energy, but also serve as key signaling hubs connecting numerous metabolic processes to essential cellular and organismal functions 1-3. It is therefore not surprising that the dysfunction of mitochondria is tightly associated with aging, as well as diverse human age-related diseases, including those affecting metabolic, cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems, as well as cancer 2,4-7. Moreover, mitochondria function as platforms to regulate programmed cell death and innate immune responses 1,8,9. Multiple mitochondrial stress response (MSR) pathways have evolved to adapt mitochondrial function to the ever-changing cellular milieu and to a variety of extracellular cues 10,11. However, aberrant activation of these MSR pathways may also be maladaptive and contribute to disease and aging 2 , underscoring the importance of the tight control of these regulatory circuits. The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR mt), one of these MSR pathways, is triggered by mitochondrial-to-nuclear communication, leading to an adaptive transcriptional response that promotes repair and recovery of the cell or organism from transient mitochondrial dysfunction 10-13. It recently emerged that activation of the UPR mt provides resistance to pathogen infections (for example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in Caenorhabditis elegans, and animals that failed to activate UPR mt during P. aeruginosa infection died earlier, suggesting that the UPR mt is a bona fide component of the innate immune response 14,15. In mammalian cells, mitochondrial perturbations also lead to cellular stress responses closely associated with innate immunity 9,16 ; for example, herpesvirus infections induce a mitochondrial DNA stress response, which enhances antiviral signaling and type I interferon responses and thereby confers viral resistance 17 .},

year ={},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-023-40088-1},
abstract ={In post-reproductive C. elegans, destructive somatic biomass repurposing supports production of yolk which, it was recently shown, is vented and can serve as a foodstuff for larval progeny. This is reminiscent of the suicidal reproductive effort (reproductive death) typical of semelparous organisms such as Pacific salmon. To explore the possibility that C. elegans exhibits reproductive death, we have compared sibling species pairs of the genera Caenorhabditis and Pristionchus with hermaphrodites and females. We report that yolk venting and constitutive, early pathology involving major anatomical changes occur only in hermaphrodites, which are also shorter lived. Moreover, only in hermaphrodites does germline removal suppress senescent pathology and markedly increase lifespan. This is consistent with the hypothesis that C. elegans exhibit reproductive death that is suppressed by germline ablation. If correct, this would imply a major difference in the ageing process between C. elegans and most higher organisms, and potentially explain the exceptional plasticity in C. elegans ageing. 1234567890():,; 1234567890():,;},

ExCel enables simultaneous readout of fluorescent proteins, RNA, DNA location, and anatomical structures at resolutions of ~65-75 nm (3.3-3.8x linear expansion). We also developed epitope-preserving ExCel, which enables imaging of endogenous proteins stained by antibodies, and iterative ExCel, which enables imaging of fluorescent proteins after 20x linear expansion. We demonstrate the utility of the ExCel toolbox for mapping synaptic proteins, for identifying previously unreported proteins at cell junctions, and for gene expression analysis in multiple individual neurons of the same animal.},

year ={2022},

abstract ={Dietary restriction (DR) is known to promote autophagy to exert its longevity effect. While SAMS-1 (S-adenosyl methionine synthetase-1) has been shown to be a key mediator of the DR response, little is known about the roles of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and SAM-dependent methyltransferase in autophagy and DR-induced longevity. In this study, we show that DR and SAMS-1 repress the activity of SET-2, a histone H3K4 methyltransferase, by limiting the availability of SAM. Consequently, the reduced H3K4me3 levels promote the expression and activity of two transcription factors, HLH-30/ TFEB and PHA-4/FOXA, which both regulate the transcription of autophagy-related genes. We then find that HLH-30/TFEB and PHA-4/FOXA act collaboratively on their common target genes to mediate the transcriptional response of autophagy-related genes and consequently the lifespan of the animals. Our study thus shows that the SAMS-1-SET-2 axis serves as a nutrient-sensing module to epigenetically coordinate the activation of HLH-30/TFEB and PHA-4/FOXA transcription factors to control macroautophagy/autophagy and longevity in response to DR.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.1038/s41392-022-01211-8},
abstract ={Aging is accompanied by the decline of organismal functions and a series of prominent hallmarks, including genetic and epigenetic alterations. These aging-associated epigenetic changes include DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) regulation, and RNA modification, all of which participate in the regulation of the aging process, and hence contribute to aging-related diseases. Therefore, understanding the epigenetic mechanisms in aging will provide new avenues to develop strategies to delay aging. Indeed, aging interventions based on manipulating epigenetic mechanisms have led to the alleviation of aging or the extension of the lifespan in animal models. Small molecule-based therapies and reprogramming strategies that enable epigenetic rejuvenation have been developed for ameliorating or reversing aging-related conditions. In addition, adopting health-promoting activities, such as caloric restriction, exercise, and calibrating circadian rhythm, has been demonstrated to delay aging. Furthermore, various clinical trials for aging intervention are ongoing, providing more evidence of the safety and efficacy of these therapies. Here, we review recent work on the epigenetic regulation of aging and outline the advances in intervention strategies for aging and age-associated diseases. A better understanding of the critical roles of epigenetics in the aging process will lead to more clinical advances in the prevention of human aging and therapy of aging-related diseases.},

title ={The one-carbon pool controls mitochondrial energy metabolism via complex I and iron-sulfur clusters},
year ={2024},
doi ={},
abstract ={Induction of the one-carbon cycle is an early hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer metabolism. Vital intermediary steps are localized to mitochondria, but it remains unclear how one-carbon availability connects to mitochondrial function. Here, we show that the one-carbon metabolite and methyl group donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is pivotal for energy metabolism. A gradual decline in mitochondrial SAM (mitoSAM) causes hierarchical defects in fly and mouse, comprising loss of mitoSAM-dependent metabolites and impaired assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Complex I stability and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis are directly controlled by mitoSAM levels, while other protein targets are predominantly methylated outside of the organelle before import. The mitoSAM pool follows its cytosolic production, establishing mitochondria as responsive receivers of onecarbon units. Thus, we demonstrate that cellular methylation potential is required for energy metabolism, with direct relevance for pathophysiology, aging, and cancer.},

year ={2018},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.35037.001},
abstract ={How multicellular organisms respond to and are impacted by severe hypothermic stress is largely unknown. From C. elegans screens for mutants abnormally responding to coldwarming stimuli, we identify a molecular genetic pathway comprising ISY-1, a conserved uncharacterized protein, and ZIP-10, a bZIP-type transcription factor. ISY-1 gatekeeps the ZIP-10 transcriptional program by regulating the microRNA mir-60. Downstream of ISY-1 and mir-60, zip-10 levels rapidly and specifically increase upon transient cold-warming exposure. Prolonged zip-10 up-regulation induces several protease-encoding genes and promotes stress-induced organismic death, or phenoptosis, of C. elegans. zip-10 deficiency confers enhanced resistance to prolonged cold-warming stress, more prominently in adults than larvae. We conclude that the ZIP-10 genetic program mediates cold-warming response and may have evolved to promote wild-population kin selection under resource-limiting and thermal stress conditions.},

doi ={10.1038/s41467-022-28272-1},
abstract ={Sustained mitochondrial fitness relies on coordinated biogenesis and clearance. Both processes are regulated by constant targeting of proteins into the organelle. Thus, mitochondrial protein import sets the pace for mitochondrial abundance and function. However, our understanding of mitochondrial protein translocation as a regulator of longevity remains enigmatic. Here, we targeted the main protein import translocases and assessed their contribution to mitochondrial abundance and organismal physiology. We find that reduction in cellular mitochondrial load through mitochondrial protein import system suppression, referred to as MitoMISS, elicits a distinct longevity paradigm. We show that MitoMISS triggers the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, orchestrating an adaptive reprogramming of metabolism. Glycolysis and de novo serine biosynthesis are causatively linked to longevity, whilst mitochondrial chaperone induction is dispensable for lifespan extension. Our findings extent the pro-longevity role of UPR mt and provide insight, relevant to the metabolic alterations that promote or undermine survival and longevity.},

title ={Nuclear metabolism and the regulation of the epigenome},
year ={2020},
doi ={10.1038/s42255-020-00285-4},
abstract ={ellular metabolism supports every biological activity within the cell. Metabolic pathways are responsible for the conversion of extracellular nutrients such as glucose, fatty acids, amino acids and vitamins into a wide range of intracellular metabolites. These basic biochemical components can then be combined into complex macromolecules (anabolism) or broken down for the generation of energy and reducing power (catabolism) 1. Because metabolic pathways are highly intersectional, metabolic conversions must be compartmentalized in subcellular locations. Metabolic compartmentalization can be obtained through the formation of local enzyme complexes; temporal separation of reactions; or controlled influx and efflux of metabolites into isolated organelles, such as the mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and peroxisomes 2. However, given the inability of the nuclear pores to prevent the passage of metabolites, the nucleus has long been considered to be in metabolic homeostasis with the cytoplasm 3. Nevertheless, the establishment of the so-called epigenetic code through the chemical modification of chromatin is dependent on the same core metabolites that form the basis of cellular metabolism. Because chromatin modifications are crucial to the maintenance of cellular identity and function, mechanisms regulating nuclear metabolite pools are expected to exist. In this Review, we provide a framework to understand the interaction of cellular and nuclear metabolism, with an emphasis on the nodal metabolites that regulate central carbon metabolism and the epigenome. We give an overview of mechanisms that shield the epigenetic regulation of gene expression from fluctuations in cytoplasmic metabolite levels and discuss the controlled exchange in metabolites between the nuclear and non-nuclear compartments. Finally, we propose that disruption of the nuclear metabolite pools may underlie disease.},

title ={Region-specific H3K9me3 gain in aged somatic tissues in Caenorhabditis elegans},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1009432},
abstract ={Epigenetic alterations occur as organisms age, and lead to chromatin deterioration, loss of transcriptional silencing and genomic instability. Dysregulation of the epigenome has been associated with increased susceptibility to age-related disorders. In this study, we aimed to characterize the age-dependent changes of the epigenome and, in turn, to understand epigenetic processes that drive aging phenotypes. We focused on the aging-associated changes in the repressive histone marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in C. elegans. We observed region-specific gain and loss of both histone marks, but the changes are more evident for H3K9me3. We further found alteration of heterochromatic boundaries in aged somatic tissues. Interestingly, we discovered that the most statistically significant changes reflected H3K9me3-marked regions that are formed during aging, and are absent in developing worms, which we termed "aging-specific repressive regions" (ASRRs). These ASRRs preferentially occur in genic regions that are marked by high levels of H3K9me2 and H3K36me2 in larval stages. Maintenance of high H3K9me2 levels in these regions have been shown to correlate with a longer lifespan. Next, we examined whether the changes in repressive histone marks lead to de-silencing of repetitive DNA elements, as reported for several other organisms. We observed increased expression of active repetitive DNA elements but not global re-activation of silent repeats in old worms, likely due to the distributed nature of repetitive elements in the C. elegans genome. Intriguingly, CELE45, a putative short interspersed nuclear element (SINE), was greatly overexpressed at old age and upon heat stress. SINEs have been suggested to regulate transcription in response to various cellular stresses in mammals. It is likely that CELE45 RNAs also play roles in stress response and aging in C. elegans. Taken together, our study revealed significant and specific agedependent changes in repressive histone modifications and repetitive elements, providing important insights into aging biology.},

doi ={10.15252/embr.202255548},
abstract ={Mechanisms underlying the depletion of NAD + and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aging and age-related disorders remain poorly defined. We show that reverse electron transfer (RET) at mitochondrial complex I, which causes increased ROS production and NAD + to NADH conversion and thus lowered NAD + / NADH ratio, is active during aging. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of RET decreases ROS production and increases NAD + / NADH ratio, extending the lifespan of normal flies. The lifespanextending effect of RET inhibition is dependent on NAD +dependent Sirtuin, highlighting the importance of NAD + /NADH rebalance, and on longevity-associated Foxo and autophagy pathways. RET and RET-induced ROS and NAD + /NADH ratio changes are prominent in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model and fly models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of RET prevents the accumulation of faulty translation products resulting from inadequate ribosomemediated quality control, rescues relevant disease phenotypes, and extends the lifespan of Drosophila and mouse AD models. Deregulated RET is therefore a conserved feature of aging, and inhibition of RET may open new therapeutic opportunities in the context of aging and age-related diseases including AD.},

title ={Compartmentalised acyl-CoA metabolism and roles in chromatin regulation},
year ={2020},
doi ={10.1016/j.molmet.2020.01.005},
abstract ={Background: Many metabolites serve as important signalling molecules to adjust cellular activities and functions based on nutrient availability. Links between acetyl-CoA metabolism, histone lysine acetylation, and gene expression have been documented and studied over the past decade. In recent years, several additional acyl modifications to histone lysine residues have been identified, which depend on acyl-coenzyme A thioesters (acyl-CoAs) as acyl donors. Acyl-CoAs are intermediates of multiple distinct metabolic pathways, and substantial evidence has emerged that histone acylation is metabolically sensitive. Nevertheless, the metabolic sources of acyl-CoAs used for chromatin modification in most cases remain poorly understood. Elucidating how these diverse chemical modifications are coupled to and regulated by cellular metabolism is important in deciphering their functional significance. Scope of review: In this article, we review the metabolic pathways that produce acyl-CoAs, as well as emerging evidence for functional roles of diverse acyl-CoAs in chromatin regulation. Because acetyl-CoA has been extensively reviewed elsewhere, we will focus on four other acyl-CoA metabolites integral to major metabolic pathways that are also known to modify histones: succinyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, crotonoyl-CoA, and butyryl-CoA. We also briefly mention several other acyl-CoA species, which present opportunities for further research; malonyl-CoA, glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA, and lactyl-CoA. Each acyl-CoA species has distinct roles in metabolism, indicating the potential to report shifts in the metabolic status of the cell. For each metabolite, we consider the metabolic pathways in which it participates and the nutrient sources from which it is derived, the compartmentalisation of its metabolism, and the factors reported to influence its abundance and potential nuclear availability. We also highlight reported biological functions of these metabolically-linked acylation marks. Finally, we aim to illuminate key questions in acyl-CoA metabolism as they relate to the control of chromatin modification. Major conclusions: A majority of acyl-CoA species are annotated to mitochondrial metabolic processes. Since acyl-CoAs are not known to be directly transported across mitochondrial membranes, they must be synthesized outside of mitochondria and potentially within the nucleus to participate in chromatin regulation. Thus, subcellular metabolic compartmentalisation likely plays a key role in the regulation of histone acylation. Metabolite tracing in combination with targeting of relevant enzymes and transporters will help to map the metabolic pathways that connect acyl-CoA metabolism to chromatin modification. The specific function of each acyl-CoA may be determined in part by biochemical properties that affect its propensity for enzymatic versus non-enzymatic protein modification, as well as the various enzymes that can add, remove and bind each modification. Further, competitive and inhibitory effects of different acyl-CoA species on these enzymes make determining the relative abundance of acyl-CoA species in specific contexts important to understand the regulation of chromatin acylation. An improved and more nuanced understanding of metabolic regulation of chromatin and its roles in physiological and disease-related processes will emerge as these questions are answered.},

year ={2021},

abstract ={The Golgi complex is the membrane-bound organelle that lies at the center of the secretory pathway. Its main functions are to maintain cellular lipid homeostasis, to orchestrate protein processing and maturation, and to mediate protein sorting and export. These functions are not independent of one another, and they all require that the membranes of the Golgi complex have a well-defined biochemical composition. Importantly, a finelyregulated spatiotemporal organization of the Golgi membrane components is essential for the correct performance of the organelle. In here, we review our current mechanistic and molecular understanding of how Golgi membranes are spatially organized in the lateral and axial directions to fulfill their functions. In particular, we highlight the current evidence and proposed models of intra-Golgi transport, as well as the known mechanisms for the retention of Golgi residents and for the sorting and export of transmembrane cargo proteins. Despite the controversies, conflicting evidence, clashes between models, and technical limitations, the field has moved forward and we have gained extensive knowledge in this fascinating topic. However, there are still many important questions that remain to be completely answered. We hope that this review will help boost future investigations on these issues.},

title ={Relationship Between Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain Dysfunction, Development, and Life Extension in Caenorhabditis elegans},
year ={2007},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pbio.0050259},
abstract ={Prior studies have shown that disruption of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) function in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can result in life extension. Counter to these findings, many mutations that disrupt ETC function in humans are known to be pathologically life-shortening. In this study, we have undertaken the first formal investigation of the role of partial mitochondrial ETC inhibition and its contribution to the life-extension phenotype of C. elegans. We have developed a novel RNA interference (RNAi) dilution strategy to incrementally reduce the expression level of five genes encoding mitochondrial proteins in C. elegans: atp-3, nuo-2, isp-1, cco-1, and frataxin (frh-1). We observed that each RNAi treatment led to marked alterations in multiple ETC components. Using this dilution technique, we observed a consistent, three-phase lifespan response to increasingly greater inhibition by RNAi: at low levels of inhibition, there was no response, then as inhibition increased, lifespan responded by monotonically lengthening. Finally, at the highest levels of RNAi inhibition, lifespan began to shorten. Indirect measurements of whole-animal oxidative stress showed no correlation with life extension. Instead, larval development, fertility, and adult size all became coordinately affected at the same point at which lifespan began to increase. We show that a specific signal, initiated during the L3/L4 larval stage of development, is sufficient for initiating mitochondrial dysfunction-dependent life extension in C. elegans. This stage of development is characterized by the last somatic cell divisions normally undertaken by C. elegans and also by massive mitochondrial DNA expansion. The coordinate effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on several cell cycle-dependent phenotypes, coupled with recent findings directly linking cell cycle progression with mitochondrial activity in C. elegans, lead us to propose that cell cycle checkpoint control plays a key role in specifying longevity of mitochondrial mutants.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.3390/metabo12100961},
abstract ={Vitamin B micronutrients are essential regulators of one carbon metabolism that ensures human health. Vitamin B9, or folate, lies at the heart of the folate cycle and converges with the methionine cycle to complete the one carbon pathway. Additionally, vitamin B6 contributes by orchestrating the flux of one carbon cycling. Dysregulation of vitamin B contributes to altered biochemical signaling that manifests in a spectrum of human diseases. This review presents an analysis of the past, present, and future work, highlighting the interplay between folate and vitamin B6 in one carbon metabolism. Emerging insights include advances in metabolomic-based mass spectrometry and the use of live-cell metabolic labeling. Cancer is used as a focal point to dissect vitamin crosstalk and highlight new insights into the roles of folate and vitamin B6 in metabolic control. This collection of vitamin-based research detailing the trends of one carbon metabolism in human disease exemplifies how the future of personalized medicine could unfold using this new base of knowledge and ultimately provide next-generation therapeutics.},

title ={The nematode worm C. elegans chooses between bacterial foods exactly as if maximizing economic utility Authors},
year ={},
doi ={10.1101/2021.04.25.441352},
abstract ={In value-based decision making, options are selected according to subjective values assigned by the individual to available goods and actions. Despite the importance of this faculty of the mind, the neural mechanisms of value assignments, and how choices are directed by them, remain obscure. To investigate this problem, we used a classic measure of utility maximization, the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference, to quantify internal consistency of food preferences in Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm with a nervous system of only 302 neurons. Using a novel combination of microfluidics and electrophysiology, we found that C. elegans food choices fulfill the necessary and sufficient conditions for utility maximization, indicating that nematodes behave exactly as if they maintain, and attempt to maximize, an underlying representation of subjective value. Food choices are well-fit by a utility function widely used to model human consumers. Moreover, as in many other animals, subjective values in C. elegans are learned, a process we now find requires intact dopamine signaling. Differential responses of identified chemosensory neurons to foods with distinct growth potential are amplified by prior consumption of these foods, suggesting that these neurons may be part of a value-assignment system. The demonstration of utility maximization in an organism with a nervous system of only 302 neurons sets a new lower bound on the computational requirements for its execution, and offers the prospect of an essentially complete explanation of value-based decision making at single neuron resolution.},

abstract ={Methylation of carbon-5 of cytosines (m 5 C) is a post-transcriptional nucleotide modification of RNA found in all kingdoms of life. While individual m 5 C-methyltransferases have been studied, the impact of the global cytosine-5 methylome on development, homeostasis and stress remains unknown. Here, using Caenorhabditis elegans, we generated the first organism devoid of m 5 C in RNA, demonstrating that this modification is non-essential. We determined the localisation and enzymatic specificity of m 5 C sites in RNA in vivo and showed that animals devoid of m 5 C are sensitive to temperature stress. At the molecular level, we showed that loss of m 5 C specifically impacts decoding of leucine and proline thus reducing the translation efficiency of transcripts enriched in these amino acids. Finally, we found translation of leucine UUG codons to be the most strongly affected upon heat shock, suggesting a role of m 5 C tRNA wobble methylation in the adaptation to heat stress.},

abstract ={Multicellular organisms are composed of distinct cells and tissues that coordinate highly orchestrated responses to environmental challenges, including those that arise with age. Since C. elegans is a premier model system used to study the molecular and cellular regulators of adult and aging phenotypes, cell typeand tissue-specific approaches are needed to characterize the genome-wide expression changes associated with these responses. Here we describe a method for the FACS-based isolation and RNA sequencing of dissociated cells from adult C. elegans. This technique is amenable to profiling the cell-and tissue-specific gene expression changes in C. elegans mutants, including aging models, such as the daf-2/insulin-like signaling (IIS) pathway, and in wild-type animals with age.},

title ={Four families of folate-independent methionine synthases},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1009342},
abstract ={Although most organisms synthesize methionine from homocysteine and methyl folates, some have "core" methionine synthases that lack folate-binding domains and use other methyl donors. In vitro, the characterized core synthases use methylcobalamin as a methyl donor, but in vivo, they probably rely on corrinoid (vitamin B12-binding) proteins. We identified four families of core methionine synthases that are distantly related to each other (under 30% pairwise amino acid identity). From the characterized enzymes, we identified the families MesA, which is found in methanogens, and MesB, which is found in anaerobic bacteria and archaea with the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. A third uncharacterized family, MesC, is found in anaerobic archaea that have the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and lack known forms of methionine synthase. We predict that most members of the MesB and MesC families accept methyl groups from the iron-sulfur corrinoid protein of that pathway. The fourth family, MesD, is found only in aerobic bacteria. Using transposon mutants and complementation, we show that MesD does not require 5-methyltetrahydrofolate or cobalamin. Instead, MesD requires an uncharacterized protein family (DUF1852) and oxygen for activity.},

doi ={10.1016/j.arr.2021.101407},
abstract ={With the goal of representing common denominators of aging in different organisms López-Otín et al. in 2013 described nine hallmarks of aging. Since then, this representation has become a major reference point for the biogerontology field. The template for the hallmarks of aging account originated from landmark papers by Hanahan and Weinberg (2000, 2011) defining first six and later ten hallmarks of cancer. Here we assess the strengths and weaknesses of the hallmarks of aging account. As a checklist of diverse major foci of current aging research, it has provided a useful shared overview for biogerontology during a time of transition in the field. It also seems useful in applied biogerontology, to identify interventions (e.g. drugs) that impact multiple symptomatic features of aging. However, while the hallmarks of cancer provide a paradigmatic account of the causes of cancer with profound explanatory power, the hallmarks of aging do not. A worry is that as a non-paradigm the hallmarks of aging have obscured the urgent need to define a genuine paradigm, one that can provide a useful basis for understanding the mechanistic causes of the diverse aging pathologies. We argue that biogerontology must look and move beyond the hallmarks to understand the process of aging. In its normal state, then, a scientific community is an immensely efficient instrument for solving the problems or puzzles that its paradigms define. (Kuhn 1962) p. 166.},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.1101/2020.09.13.295451},
abstract ={Intestinal microbiota play an essential role in the health of a host organism. Here, we define how commensal Escherichia coli (E. coli) alters its host after long term exposure to glucose using a C. elegans-E. coli system. Our data reveal that bacterial processing of glucose, rather than direct ingestion by the animal, results in reduced lifespan and healthspan, including reduced locomotion, oxidative stress resistance, and heat stress resistance in C. elegans. Chronic exposure of E. coli to glucose produces growth defects and increased advanced glycation end products within the E. coli. These negative effects are abrogated when the E. coli is not able to process the additional glucose and by the addition of the anti-glycation compound carnosine. Physiological changes of the host C. elegans are accompanied by dysregulation of detoxifying genes including glyoxalase, glutathione-Stransferase, and superoxide dismutase. Loss of gst-4 shortens C. elegans lifespan and blunts the animal's response to a glucose-fed bacteria diet. Taken together, we reveal that added dietary sugar may alter intestinal microbial E. coli to decrease lifespan and healthspan of the host and define the critical role of detoxification genes in maintaining health during a chronic high-sugar diet.},

abstract ={Ageing is a complex process with common and distinct features across tissues. Unveiling the underlying processes driving ageing in individual tissues is indispensable to decipher the mechanisms of organismal longevity. Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-established model organism that has spearheaded ageing research with the discovery of numerous genetic pathways controlling its lifespan. However, it remains challenging to dissect the ageing of worm tissues due to the limited description of tissue pathology and access to tissue-specific molecular changes during ageing. In this study, we isolated cells from five major tissues in young and old worms and profiled the age-induced transcriptomic changes within these tissues. We observed a striking diversity of ageing across tissues and identified different sets of longevity regulators therein. In addition, we found novel tissue-specific factors, including irx-1 and myrf-2, which control the integrity of the intestinal barrier and sarcomere structure during ageing respectively. This study demonstrates the complexity of ageing across worm tissues and highlights the power of tissue-specific transcriptomic profiling during ageing, which can serve as a resource to the field.},

abstract ={Despite increasingly detailed knowledge of gene expression patterns, the regulatory architectures that drive them are not well understood. To address this, we compared transcriptional and regulatory element activities across five adult tissues of C. elegans , covering ~90% of cells, and defined regulatory grammars associated with ubiquitous, germline and somatic tissue-specific gene expression patterns. We find architectural features that distinguish two major promoter types. Germline-specific and ubiquitously-active promoters have well positioned +1 and-1 nucleosomes associated with a periodic 10-bp WW signal. Somatic tissue-specific promoters lack these features, have wider nucleosome depleted regions, and are more enriched for core promoter elements, which surprisingly differ between tissues. A 10-bp periodic WW signal is also associated with +1 nucleosomes of ubiquitous promoters in fly and zebrafish but is not detected in mouse and human. Our results demonstrate fundamental differences in regulatory architectures of germline-active and somatic tissue-specific genes and provide a key resource for future studies.},

title ={Phosphatidylcholine Affects Inner Membrane Protein Translocases of Mitochondria},
year ={2016},
doi ={10.1074/jbc.M116.722694},
abstract ={Two protein translocases transport precursor proteins into or across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The presequence translocase (TIM23 complex) sorts precursor proteins with a cleavable presequence either into the matrix or into the inner membrane. The carrier translocase (TIM22 complex) inserts multispanning proteins into the inner membrane. Both protein import pathways depend on the presence of a membrane potential, which is generated by the activity of the respiratory chain. The non-bilayer-forming phospholipids cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine are required for the activity of the respiratory chain and therefore to maintain the membrane potential for protein import. Depletion of cardiolipin further affects the stability of the TIM23 complex. The role of bilayer-forming phospholipids like phosphatidylcholine (PC) in protein transport into the inner membrane and the matrix is unknown. Here, we report that import of presequence-containing precursors and carrier proteins is impaired in PC-deficient mitochondria. Surprisingly, depletion of PC does not affect stability and activity of respiratory supercomplexes, and the membrane potential is maintained. Instead, the dynamic TIM23 complex is destabilized when the PC levels are reduced, whereas the TIM22 complex remains intact. Our analysis further revealed that initial precursor binding to the TIM23 complex is impaired in PC-deficient mitochondria. We conclude that reduced PC levels differentially affect the TIM22 and TIM23 complexes in mitochondrial protein transport.},

title ={UPR ER promotes lipophagy independent of chaperones to extend life span},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={Longevity is dictated by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. One of the key mechanisms to regulate lifespan extension is the induction of protein chaperones for protein homeostasis. Ectopic activation of the unfolded protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPR ER) specifically in neurons is sufficient to enhance organismal stress resistance and extend life span. Here, we find that this activation not only promotes chaperones but also facilitates ER restructuring and ER function. This restructuring is concomitant with lipid depletion through lipophagy. Activation of lipophagy is distinct from chaperone induction and is required for the lifespan extension found in this paradigm. Last, we find that overexpression of the lipophagy component, ehbp-1, is sufficient to deplete lipids, remodel ER, and promote life span. Therefore, UPR induction in neurons triggers two distinct programs in the periphery: the proteostasis arm through protein chaperones and metabolic changes through lipid depletion mediated by EH domain binding protein 1 (EHBP-1).},

abstract ={Lipids play crucial roles in regulating aging and longevity. In the past few decades, a series of genetic pathways have been discovered to regulate lifespan in model organisms. Interestingly, many of these regulatory pathways are linked to lipid metabolism and lipid signaling. Lipid metabolic enzymes undergo significant changes during aging and are regulated by different longevity pathways. Lipids also actively modulate lifespan and health span as signaling molecules. In this review, we summarize recent insights into the roles of lipid metabolism and lipid signaling in aging and discuss lipid-related interventions in promoting longevity.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.02.09.527915},
abstract ={Reproductive aging is one of the earliest human aging phenotypes, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to oocyte quality decline. However, it is not known which mitochondrial metabolic processes are critical for oocyte quality maintenance with age. To understand how mitochondrial processes contribute to C. elegans oocyte quality, we characterized the mitochondrial proteomes of young and aged wild-type and long-reproductive daf-2 mutants. Here we show that the mitochondrial proteomic profiles of young wild-type and daf-2 worms are similar and share upregulation of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism pathway enzymes. Reduction of the BCAA catabolism enzyme BCAT-1 shortens reproduction, elevates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels, and shifts mitochondrial localization. Moreover, bcat-1 knockdown decreases oocyte quality in daf-2 worms and reduces reproductive capability, indicating the role of this pathway in the maintenance of oocyte quality with age. Importantly, oocyte quality deterioration can be delayed, and reproduction can be extended in wild-type animals both by bcat-1 overexpression and by supplementing with Vitamin B1, a cofactor needed for BCAA metabolism.},

title ={CRTC-1 balances histone trimethylation and acetylation to promote longevity},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.1101/2022.08.31.506037},
abstract ={Loss of function during ageing is accompanied by transcriptional drift, altering gene expression and contributing to a variety of age-related diseases. CREB regulated transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs) have emerged as key regulators of gene expression that might be targeted to promote longevity. Here, we define the role of the Caenorhabditis elegans CRTC-1 in the epigenetic regulation of longevity. Endogenous CRTC-1 binds chromatin factors, including components of the COMPASS complex, which trimethylates lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3). CRISPR editing of endogenous CRTC-1 reveals that the CREBbinding domain in neurons is specifically required for H3K4me3-dependent longevity. However, this effect is independent of CREB but instead acts via the transcription factor AP-1. Strikingly, CRTC-1 also mediates global histone acetylation levels, and this acetylation is essential for H3K4me3-dependent longevity. Indeed, overexpression of an acetyltransferase enzyme is sufficient to promote longevity in wild-type worms. CRTCs, therefore, link energetics to longevity by critically fine-tuning histone acetylation and methylation to promote healthy ageing.},

doi ={10.1038/s41467-023-43527-1},
abstract ={Tryptophan metabolism through the kynurenine pathway influences molecular processes critical to healthy aging including immune signaling, redox homeostasis, and energy production. Aberrant kynurenine metabolism occurs during normal aging and is implicated in many age-associated pathologies including chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, and cancer. We and others previously identified three kynurenine pathway genestdo-2, kynu-1, and acsd-1-for which decreasing expression extends lifespan in invertebrates. Here we report that knockdown of haao-1, a fourth gene encoding the enzyme 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA) dioxygenase (HAAO), extends lifespan by ~30% and delays age-associated health decline in Caenorhabditis elegans. Lifespan extension is mediated by increased physiological levels of the HAAO substrate 3HAA. 3HAA increases oxidative stress resistance and activates the Nrf2/SKN-1 oxidative stress response. In pilot studies, female Haao knockout mice or aging wild type male mice fed 3HAA supplemented diet were also long-lived. HAAO and 3HAA represent potential therapeutic targets for aging and age-associated disease.},

doi ={10.1101/2024.01.06.574476},
abstract ={How cell replication ultimately results in aging and the Hayflick limit are not fully understood. Here we show that clock-like accumulation of DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) throughout cell replication drives conserved aging mechanisms. G4 stimulates transcription-replication interactions to delay genome replication and impairs DNA re-methylation and histone modification recovery, leading to loss of heterochromatin. This creates a more permissive local environment for G4 formation in subsequent generations. As a result, G4s gradually accumulate on promoters throughout mitosis, driving clock-like DNA hypomethylation and chromatin opening. In patients and in vitro models, loss-of-function mutations in the G4-resolving enzymes WRN, BLM and ERCC8 accelerate the erosion of the epigenomic landscape around G4. G4-driven epigenomic aging is strongly correlated with biological age and is conserved in yeast, nematodes, insects, fish, rodents, and humans. Our results revealed a universal molecular mechanism of aging and provided mechanistic insight into how G-quadruplex processor mutations drive premature aging.},

year ={2019},
doi ={10.1074/jbc.RA119.010032},
abstract ={Edited by Joel M. Gottesfeld The SIN3 histone-modifying complex regulates the expression of multiple methionine catabolic genes, including SAM synthetase (Sam-S), as well as SAM levels. To further dissect the relationship between methionine catabolism and epigenetic regulation by SIN3, we sought to identify genes and metabolic pathways controlled by SIN3 and SAM synthetase (SAM-S) in Drosophila melanogaster. Using several approaches, including RNAi-mediated gene silencing, RNA-Seq-and quantitative RT-PCR-based transcriptomics, and ultra-high-performance LC-MS/MS-and GC/MS-based metabolomics, we found that, as a global transcriptional regulator, SIN3 impacted a wide range of genes and pathways. In contrast, SAM-S affected only a narrow range of genes and pathways. The expression and levels of additional genes and metabolites, however, were altered in Sin3A؉Sam-S dual knockdown cells. This analysis revealed that SIN3 and SAM-S regulate overlapping pathways, many of which involve one-carbon and central carbon metabolisms. In some cases, the factors acted independently; in some others, redundantly; and for a third set, in opposition. Together, these results, obtained from experiments with the chromatin regulator SIN3 and the metabolic enzyme SAM-S, uncover a complex relationship between metabolism and epigenetic regulation.},

Notably, voyAGEr was created to assist researchers with no expertise in bioinformatics, providing a supportive framework for elaborating, testing and refining their hypotheses on the molecular nature of human ageing and its association with pathologies, thereby also aiding in the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. voyAGEr is freely available at https:// compbio.imm.medicina.ulisboa.pt/app/voyAGEr. eLife assessment This work presents an important online platform designed to facilitate the exploration of genes and genetic pathways implicated in human aging. Leveraging a new inference methodology, the tool enables the identification and visualization of key genes and tissues impacted by aging, facilitating scientific discovery. The methods and analyses are convincing and will be broadly used by scientists aiming to mine human aging RNA-seq data.},

year ={2024},
doi ={10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae116},
abstract ={One-carbon metabolism is a complex network of metabolic reactions that are essential for cellular function including DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 and folate are micronutrients that are utilized in this pathway and their deficiency can result in the perturbation of onecarbon metabolism and subsequent perturbations in DNA replication and repair. This effect has been well characterized in nuclear DNA but to date, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has not been investigated extensively. Mitochondrial variants have been associated with several inherited and age-related disease states; therefore, the study of factors that impact heteroplasmy are important for advancing our understanding of the mitochondrial genome's impact on human health. Heteroplasmy studies require robust and efficient mitochondrial DNA enrichment to carry out in-depth mtDNA sequencing. Many of the current methods for mtDNA enrichment can introduce biases and false-positive results. Here, we use a method that overcomes these limitations and have applied it to assess mitochondrial heteroplasmy in mouse models of altered one-carbon metabolism. Vitamin B12 deficiency was found to cause increased levels of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy across all tissues that were investigated. Folic acid supplementation also contributed to elevated mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy across all mouse tissues investigated. Heteroplasmy analysis of human data from the Framingham Heart Study suggested a potential sex-specific effect of folate and vitamin B12 status on mitochondrial heteroplasmy. This is a novel relationship that may have broader consequences for our understanding of one-carbon metabolism, mitochondrial-related disease and the influence of nutrients on DNA mutation rates.},

abstract ={Olfactory and metabolic dysfunctions are intertwined phenomena associated with obesity and neurodegenerative diseases; yet how mechanistically olfaction regulates metabolic homeostasis remains unclear. Specificity of olfactory perception integrates diverse environmental odors and olfactory neurons expressing different receptors. Here, we report that specific but not all olfactory neurons actively regulate fat metabolism without affecting eating behaviors in Caenorhabditis elegans, and identified specific odors that reduce fat mobilization via inhibiting these neurons. Optogenetic activation or inhibition of the responsible olfactory neural circuit promotes the loss or gain of fat storage, respectively. Furthermore, we discovered that FLP-1 neuropeptide released from this olfactory neural circuit signals through peripheral NPR-4/neuropeptide receptor, SGK-1/serum-and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase, and specific isoforms of DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor to regulate fat storage. Our work reveals molecular mechanisms underlying olfactory regulation of fat metabolism, and suggests the association between olfactory perception specificity of each individual and his/her susceptibility to the development of obesity.},

abstract ={Cell-cell interactions are crucial for multicellular organisms as they shape cellular function and ultimately organismal phenotype. However, the spatial code embedded in the molecular interactions that drive and sustain spatial organization, and in the organization that in turns drives intercellular interactions across a living animal remains to be elucidated. Here we use the expression of ligand-receptor pairs obtained from a whole-body single-cell transcriptome of Caenorhabditis elegans larvae to compute the potential for intercellular interactions through a Bray-Curtis-like metric. Leveraging a 3D atlas of C. elegans' cells, we implement a genetic algorithm to select the ligand-receptor pairs most informative of the spatial organization of cells. Validating the strategy, the selected ligand-receptor pairs are involved in known cell-migration and morphogenesis processes and we confirm a negative correlation between cell-cell distances and interactions. Thus, our computational framework helps identify cell-cell interactions and their relationship with intercellular distances, and decipher molecular bases encoding spatial information in a whole animal. Furthermore, it can also be used to elucidate associations with any other intercellular phenotype and applied to other multicellular organisms.},

abstract ={AU : Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly: Why and how we age are 2 intertwined questions that have fascinated scientists for many decades. However, attempts to answer these questions remain compartmentalized, preventing a comprehensive understanding of the aging process. We argue that the current lack of knowledge about the evolution of aging mechanisms is due to a lack of clarity regarding evolutionary theories of aging that explicitly involve physiological processes: the disposable soma theory (DST) and the developmental theory of aging (DTA). In this Essay, we propose a new hierarchical model linking genes to vital rates, enabling us to critically reevaluate the DST and DTA in terms of their relationship to evolutionary genetic theories of aging (mutation accumulation (MA) and antagonistic pleiotropy (AP)). We also demonstrate how these 2 theories can be incorporated in a unified hierarchical framework. The new framework will help to generate testable hypotheses of how the hallmarks of aging are shaped by natural selection.},

title ={Hallmarks of Aging: Causes and Consequences},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={In a recent review article published in Cell, López-Otín and colleagues conducted an exhaustive literature review and described 12 hallmarks of aging. The updated model of aging comprehensively captures the key characteristics of the aging phenotype and incorporates new pathways that play a crucial role in age-related processes. Although the updated hallmarks of aging provide a useful framework for describing the phenotype of aging, aging itself is a result of mechanistically complex and interrelated processes that happen during the lifespan of the organism. Here, I propose to shift the focus from a systematic description and categorization of the hallmarks of aging to a model that separates early, molecular origins of changes from cellular and tissue responses and represents a sequential and causative character of changes in aging. The proposed model aims to prompt discussion among the aging research community, guide future efforts in the field, and provide new ideas for investigation.},

doi ={10.1038/s41467-021-25821-y},
abstract ={The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits rapid senescence that is promoted by the insulin/IGF-1 signalling (IIS) pathway via regulated processes that are poorly understood. IIS also promotes production of yolk for egg provisioning, which in post-reproductive animals continues in an apparently futile fashion, supported by destructive repurposing of intestinal biomass that contributes to senescence. Here we show that post-reproductive mothers vent yolk which can be consumed by larvae and promotes their growth. This implies that later yolk production is not futile; instead vented yolk functions similarly to milk. Moreover, yolk venting is promoted by IIS. These findings suggest that a self-destructive, lactation-like process effects resource transfer from postreproductive C. elegans mothers to offspring, in a fashion reminiscent of semelparous organisms that reproduce in a single, suicidal burst. That this process is promoted by IIS provides insights into how and why IIS shortens lifespan in C. elegans.},

However, experimental demonstration of their presence and functions has remained challenging. We used metabolomics and in situ three-dimensional submicrometer chemical imaging of single cells by gas cluster ion beam secondary ion mass spectrometry (GCIB-SIMS) to directly visualize de novo purine biosynthesis by a multienzyme complex, the purinosome. We found that purinosomes comprise nine enzymes that act synergistically, channeling the pathway intermediates to synthesize purine nucleotides, increasing the pathway flux, and influencing the adenosine monophosphate/guanosine monophosphate ratio. Our work also highlights the application of high-resolution GCIB-SIMS for multiplexed biomolecular analysis at the level of single cells.},

abstract ={Infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria is an emerging life-threatening issue worldwide. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157: H7 (EHEC) causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome via contaminated food. Treatment of EHEC infection with antibiotics is contraindicated because of the risk of worsening the syndrome through the secreted toxins. Identifying the host factors involved in bacterial infection provides information about how to combat this pathogen. In our previous study, we showed that EHEC colonizes in the intestine of Caenorhabditis elegans. However, the host factors involved in EHEC colonization remain elusive. Thus, in this study, we aimed to identify the host factors involved in EHEC colonization. We conducted forward genetic screens to isolate mutants that enhanced EHEC colonization and named this phenotype enhanced intestinal colonization (Inc). Intriguingly, four mutants with the Inc phenotype showed significantly increased EHEC-resistant survival, which contrasts with our current knowledge. Genetic mapping and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed that these mutants have loss-of-function mutations in unc-89. Furthermore, we showed that the tolerance of unc-89(wf132) to EHEC relied on HLH-30/TFEB activation. These findings suggest that hlh-30 plays a key role in pathogen tolerance in C. elegans.},

Insights included the recognition that obesity underlies major chronic diseases, that appetite is hormonally controlled, that hepatic steatosis is not a benign finding, and that diabetes might fundamentally be a disorder of lipid metabolism. In this brief review, I describe the metamorphosis of LDs from overlooked globs of stored fat to dynamic organelles that control insulin resistance, mitochondrial oxidation, and viral replication.},

doi ={10.1093/genetics/iyad081},
abstract ={Heterochromatin is characterized by an enrichment of repetitive elements and low gene density and is often maintained in a repressed state across cell division and differentiation. The silencing is mainly regulated by repressive histone marks such as H3K9 and H3K27 methylated forms and the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family. Here, we analyzed in a tissue-specific manner the binding profile of the two HP1 homologs in Caenorhabditis elegans, HPL-1 and HPL-2, at the L4 developmental stage. We identified the genomewide binding profile of intestinal and hypodermal HPL-2 and intestinal HPL-1 and compared them with heterochromatin marks and other features. HPL-2 associated preferentially to the distal arms of autosomes and correlated positively with the methylated forms of H3K9 and H3K27. HPL-1 was also enriched in regions containing H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 but exhibited a more even distribution between autosome arms and centers. HPL-2 showed a differential tissue-specific enrichment for repetitive elements conversely with HPL-1, which exhibited a poor association. Finally, we found a significant intersection of genomic regions bound by the BLMP-1/PRDM1 transcription factor and intestinal HPL-1, suggesting a corepressive role during cell differentiation. Our study uncovers both shared and singular properties of conserved HP1 proteins, providing information about genomic binding preferences in relation to their role as heterochromatic markers.},

doi ={10.1371/journal.pbio.3002354},
abstract ={AU : Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly: The N-terminal tails of eukaryotic histones are frequently posttranslationally modified. The role of these modifications in transcriptional regulation is well-documented. However, the extent to which the enzymatic processes of histone posttranslational modification might affect metabolic regulation is less clear. Here, we investigated how histone methylation might affect metabolism using metabolomics, proteomics, and RNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, primary tumour samples and healthy tissue samples. In cancer, the expression of histone methyltransferases (HMTs) was inversely correlated to the activity of NNMT, an enzyme previously characterised as a methyl sink that disposes of excess methyl groups carried by the universal methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM or AdoMet). In healthy tissues, histone methylation was inversely correlated to the levels of an alternative methyl sink, PEMT. These associations affected the levels of multiple histone marks on chromatin genome-wide but had no detectable impact on transcriptional regulation. We show that HMTs with a variety of different associations to transcription are co-regulated by the Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor in human cells. Rb-mutant cancers show increased total HMT activity and down-regulation of NNMT. Together, our results suggest that the total activity of HMTs affects SAM metabolism, independent of transcriptional regulation.},

abstract ={Regulation of gene expression is linked to the organization of the genome. With age, chromatin alterations occur on all levels of genome organization, accompanied by changes in the gene expression profile. However, little is known about the changes in the level of transcriptional regulation. Here, we used a multi-omics approach and integrated ATAC-, RNA-and NET-seq to identify age-related changes in the chromatin landscape of murine liver and to investigate how these are linked to transcriptional regulation. We provide the first systematic inventory of the connection between aging, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptional regulation in a whole tissue. Aging in murine liver is characterized by an increase in chromatin accessibility at promoter regions, but not in an increase in transcriptional output. Instead, aging is accompanied by a decrease in promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), while initiation of transcription is not decreased as assessed by RNA polymerase mapping using CUT&RUN. Based on the data reported, we propose that these age-related changes in transcriptional regulation are due to a reduced stability of the pausing complex.},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-020-18690-4},
abstract ={The metabolic state of an organism instructs gene expression modalities, leading to changes in complex life history traits, such as longevity. Dietary restriction (DR), which positively affects health and life span across species, leads to metabolic reprogramming that enhances utilisation of fatty acids for energy generation. One direct consequence of this metabolic shift is the upregulation of cytoprotective (CyTP) genes categorized in the Gene Ontology (GO) term of "Xenobiotic Detoxification Program" (XDP). How an organism senses metabolic changes during nutritional stress to alter gene expression programs is less known. Here, using a genetic model of DR, we show that the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially linoleic acid (LA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), are increased following DR and these PUFAs are able to activate the CyTP genes. This activation of CyTP genes is mediated by the conserved p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) pathway. Consequently, genes of the PUFA biosynthesis and p38-MAPK pathway are required for multiple paradigms of DR-mediated longevity, suggesting conservation of mechanism. Thus, our study shows that PUFAs and p38-MAPK pathway function downstream of DR to help communicate the metabolic state of an organism to regulate expression of CyTP genes, ensuring extended life span.},

Loss-of-function genetic analyses indicate that 85% yield phenotypes that are consistent with activities in DNA and chromatin replication or already have described functions in these processes. We illustrate the value of this resource by identifying activities of the BET family proteins BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 in controlling DNA replication.

abstract ={Altered methionine metabolism is associated with weight gain in obesity. The methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), catalyzing the first reaction of the methionine cycle, plays an important role regulating lipid metabolism. However, its role in obesity, when a plethora of metabolic diseases occurs, is still unknown. By using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) and genetic depletion of Mat1a, here, we demonstrate that Mat1a deficiency in diet-induce obese or genetically obese mice prevented and reversed obesity and obesity-associated insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis by increasing energy expenditure in a hepatocyte FGF21 dependent fashion. The increased NRF2-mediated FGF21 secretion induced by targeting Mat1a, mobilized plasma lipids towards the BAT to be catabolized, induced thermogenesis and reduced body weight, inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis. The beneficial effects of Mat1a ASO were abolished following FGF21 depletion in hepatocytes. Thus, targeting Mat1a activates the liver-BAT axis by increasing NRF2mediated FGF21 secretion, which prevents obesity, insulin resistance and hepatosteatosis.},

abstract ={As cells age, they undergo a remarkable global change: In transcriptional drift, hundreds of genes become overexpressed while hundreds of others become underexpressed. Using archetype modeling and Gene Ontology analysis on data from aging Caenorhabditis elegans worms, we find that the upregulated genes code for sensory proteins upstream of stress responses and downregulated genes are growth-and metabolism-related. We propose a simple mechanistic model for how such global coordination of multi-protein expression levels may be achieved by the binding of a single ligand that concentrates with age. A key implication is that a cell's own responses are part of its aging process, so unlike for wear-and-tear processes, intervention might be able to modulate these effects.},

title ={Nuclear lipid droplets and nuclear damage in Caenorhabditis elegans},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1009602},
abstract ={Fat stored in the form of lipid droplets has long been considered a defining characteristic of cytoplasm. However, recent studies have shown that nuclear lipid droplets occur in multiple cells and tissues, including in human patients with fatty liver disease. The function(s) of stored fat in the nucleus has not been determined, and it is possible that nuclear fat is beneficial in some situations. Conversely, nuclear lipid droplets might instead be deleterious by disrupting nuclear organization or triggering aggregation of hydrophobic proteins. We show here that nuclear lipid droplets occur normally in C. elegans intestinal cells and germ cells, but appear to be associated with damage only in the intestine. Lipid droplets in intestinal nuclei can be associated with novel bundles of microfilaments (nuclear actin) and membrane tubules that might have roles in damage repair. To increase the normal, low frequency of nuclear lipid droplets in wild-type animals, we used a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants with abnormally large or abundant nuclear lipid droplets. Genetic analysis and cloning of three such mutants showed that the genes encode the lipid regulator SEIP-1/seipin, the inner nuclear membrane protein NEMP-1/Nemp1/TMEM194A, and a component of COPI vesicles called COPA-1/α-COP. We present several lines of evidence that the nuclear lipid droplet phenotype of copa-1 mutants results from a defect in retrieving mislocalized membrane proteins that normally reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. The seip-1 mutant causes most germ cells to have nuclear lipid droplets, the largest of which occupy more than a third of the nuclear volume. Nevertheless, the nuclear lipid droplets do not trigger apoptosis, and the germ cells differentiate into gametes that produce viable, healthy progeny. Thus, our results suggest that nuclear lipid droplets are detrimental to intestinal nuclei, but have no obvious deleterious effect on germ nuclei.},

title ={S-Adenosylmethionine Is Associated with Fat Mass and Truncal Adiposity in Older Adults},
year ={2013},
doi ={10.3945/jn.113.179192},
abstract ={S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is synthesized from methionine, which is abundant in animal-derived protein, in an energyconsuming reaction. SAM and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) correlate with body mass index (BMI). Plasma total concentration of the SAM-associated product cysteine (tCys) correlates with fat mass in humans and cysteine promotes adiposity in animals. In a cross-sectional study of 610 participants, we investigated whether SAM and SAH are associated with BMI via lean mass or fat mass and dietary protein sources as determinants of SAM and tCys concentrations. Plasma SAM was not associated with lean mass, but mean adjusted fat mass increased from 24 kg (95% CI: 22.6, 25.1) to 30 kg (95% CI: 28.7, 31.3) across SAM quartiles (P < 0.001) and trunk fat:total fat ratio increased from 0.48 to 0.52 (P < 0.001). Erythrocyte SAM was also positively associated with fat mass and trunk fat:total fat ratio. The association of SAM with fat mass was not weakened by adjustment for serum tCys, lipids, creatinine, or dietary or lifestyle confounders. Concentrations of the SAM precursor, methionine, and the SAM product, SAH, were not independently associated with adiposity. Intake of animal-derived protein was not related to serum methionine but was positively associated with plasma SAM (partial r = 0.11) and serum tCys (partial r = 0.13; P < 0.05 for both after adjustment for age, gender, and total energy intake). In conclusion, plasma SAM, but not methionine, is independently associated with fat mass and truncal adiposity, suggesting increased conversion of methionine to SAM in obese individuals. Prospective studies are needed to investigate the interactions among dietary energy and animal protein content, SAM concentrations, and change in body weight and cardiometabolic risk. J. Nutr.},

year ={2024},
doi ={10.1093/g3journal/jkae002},
abstract ={The SAM1 and SAM2 genes encode for S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthetase enzymes, with AdoMet serving as the main cellular methyl donor. We have previously shown that independent deletion of these genes alters chromosome stability and AdoMet concentrations in opposite ways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To characterize other changes occurring in these mutants, we grew wildtype, sam1Δ/sam1Δ, and sam2Δ/sam2Δ strains in 15 different Phenotypic Microarray plates with different components and measured growth variations. RNA-Sequencing was also carried out on these strains and differential gene expression determined for each mutant. We explored how the phenotypic growth differences are linked to the altered gene expression, and hypothesize mechanisms by which loss of the SAM genes and subsequent AdoMet level changes, impact pathways and processes. We present 6 stories, discussing changes in sensitivity or resistance to azoles, cisplatin, oxidative stress, arginine biosynthesis perturbations, DNA synthesis inhibitors, and tamoxifen, to demonstrate the power of this novel methodology to broadly profile changes due to gene mutations. The large number of conditions that result in altered growth, as well as the large number of differentially expressed genes with wide-ranging functionality, speaks to the broad array of impacts that altering methyl donor abundance can impart. Our findings demonstrate that some cellular changes are directly related to AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases and AdoMet availability, some are directly linked to the methyl cycle and its role in production of several important cellular components, and others reveal impacts of SAM gene mutations on previously unconnected pathways.},

abstract ={Enzymes of one-carbon (1C) metabolism play pivotal roles in proliferating cells. They are involved in the metabolism of amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids and the supply of all cellular methylations. However, there is limited information about how these enzymes are regulated during cell division and how cell cycle kinetics are affected in several loss-of-function mutants of 1C metabolism. Here, we report that the levels of the S. cerevisiae enzymes Ade17p and Cho2p, involved in the de novo synthesis of purines and phosphatidylcholine (PC), respectively, are cell cycleregulated. Cells lacking Ade17p, Cho2p, or Shm2p (an enzyme that supplies 1C units from serine) have distinct alterations in size homeostasis and cell cycle kinetics. Loss of Ade17p leads to a specific delay at START, when cells commit to a new round of cell division, while loss of Shm2p has broader effects, reducing growth rate. Furthermore, the inability to synthesize PC de novo in cho2Δ cells delays START and reduces the coherence of nuclear elongation late in the cell cycle. Loss of Cho2p also leads to profound metabolite changes. Besides the expected changes in the lipidome, cho2Δ cells have reduced levels of amino acids, resembling cells shifted to poorer media. These results reveal the different ways that 1C metabolism allocates resources to affect cell proliferation at multiple cell cycle transitions.},

abstract ={Microtubule (MT) regulation is involved in both neuronal function and the maintenance of neuronal structure, and MT dysregulation appears to be a general downstream indicator and effector of age-related neurodegeneration. But the role of MTs in natural aging is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate a role of MT regulators in regulating longevity. We find that loss of EFA-6, a modulator of MT dynamics, can delay both neuronal aging and extend the lifespan of C. elegans. Through the use of genetic mutants affecting other MT-regulating genes in C. elegans, we find that loss of MT stabilizing genes (including ptrn-1 and ptl-1) shortens lifespan, while This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

year ={2015},
doi ={10.1093/bioinformatics/btv133},
abstract ={Motivation: The 14-3-3 family of phosphoprotein-binding proteins regulates many cellular processes by docking onto pairs of phosphorylated Ser and Thr residues in a constellation of intracellular targets. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop new prediction methods that use an updated set of 14-3-3-binding motifs for the identification of new 14-3-3 targets and to prioritize the downstream analysis of >2000 potential interactors identified in high-throughput experiments. Results: Here, a comprehensive set of 14-3-3-binding targets from the literature was used to develop 14-3-3-binding phosphosite predictors. Position-specific scoring matrix, support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) classification methods were trained to discriminate experimentally determined 14-3-3-binding motifs from non-binding phosphopeptides. ANN, position-specific scoring matrix and SVM methods showed best performance for a motif window spanning from À6 to þ4 around the binding phosphosite, achieving Matthews correlation coefficient of up to 0.60. Blind prediction showed that all three methods outperform two popular 14-3-3-binding site predictors, Scansite and ELM. The new methods were used for prediction of 14-3-3-binding phosphosites in the human proteome. Experimental analysis of high-scoring predictions in the FAM122A and FAM122B proteins confirms the predictions and suggests the new 14-3-3-predictors will be generally useful. Availability and implementation: A standalone prediction web server is available at http://www. compbio.dundee.ac.uk/1433pred. Human candidate 14-3-3-binding phosphosites were integrated in ANIA: ANnotation and Integrated Analysis of the 14-3-3 interactome database.},

year ={2019},
doi ={10.3390/cells8020106},
abstract ={The electron-transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase gene (ETFDH) that encodes the ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QO) has been reported to be the major cause of multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD). ETF-QO is an electron carrier that mainly functions in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation and the delivery of electrons to the ubiquinone pool in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. A high frequency of c.250G>A has been found in Taiwanese patients with late-onset MADD. We postulated that the ETFDH c.250G>A mutation may concomitantly impair fatty acid β-oxidation and mitochondrial function. Using MADD patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells and specifically overexpressed ETFDH c.92C>T, c.250G>A, or coexisted c.92C>T and c.250G>A (c.92C>T + c.250G>A) mutated lymphoblastoid cells, we addressed the genotype-phenotype relationship of ETFDH variation in the pathogenesis of MADD. The decreased adenosine triphosphate synthesis, dissipated mitochondrial membrane potentials, reduced mitochondrial bioenergetics, and increased neutral lipid droplets and lipid peroxides were found in the MADD patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells. Riboflavin and/or coenzyme Q10 supplementation rescued cells from lipid droplet accumulation. All three mutant types, c.92C>T, c.250G>A, or c.92C>T + c.250G>A, had increased lipid droplet accumulation after treatment with palmitic acid. These results help to clarify the molecular pathogenesis of MADD as a result of the high frequency of the ETFDH c.250G>A and c.92C>T mutations.},

doi ={10.1038/s41598-022-26554-8},
abstract ={Our research group has recently found that radiation-induced airborne stress signals can be used for communication among Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). This paper addresses the question of whether heat stress can also induce the emission of airborne stress signals to alert neighboring C. elegans and elicit their subsequent stress response. Here, we report that heat-stressed C. elegans produces volatile stress signals that trigger an increase in radiation resistance in neighboring unheated C. elegans. When several loss-of-function mutations affecting thermosensory neuron (AFD), heat shock factor-1, HSP-4, and small heat-shock proteins were used to test heat-stressed C. elegans, we found that the production of volatile stress signals was blocked, demonstrating that the heat shock response and ER pathway are involved in controlling the production of volatile stress signals. Our data further indicated that mutations affecting the DNA damage response (DDR) also inhibited the increase in radiation resistance in neighboring unheated C. elegans that might have received volatile stress signals, indicating that the DDR might contribute to radioadaptive responses induction by volatile stress signals. In addition, the regulatory pattern of signal production and action was preliminarily clarified. Together, the results of this study demonstrated that heat-stressed nematodes communicate with unheated nematodes via volatile stress signals.},

title ={Exonuclease Xrn1 regulates TORC1 signaling in response to SAM availability},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.91984.1},
abstract ={Autophagy is a conserved process of cellular self-digestion that promotes survival during nutrient stress. In yeast, methionine starvation is sufficient to induce autophagy. One pathway of autophagy induction is governed by the SEACIT complex, which regulates TORC1 activity in response to amino acids through the Rag GTPases Gtr1 and Gtr2. However, the precise mechanism by which SEACIT senses amino acids and regulates TORC1 signaling remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify the conserved 5'-3' RNA exonuclease Xrn1 as a surprising and novel regulator of TORC1 activity in response to methionine starvation. This role of Xrn1 is dependent on its catalytic activity, but not on degradation of any specific class of mRNAs. Instead, Xrn1 modulates the nucleotide-binding state of the Gtr1/2 complex, which is critical for its interaction with and activation of TORC1. This work identifies a critical role for Xrn1 in nutrient sensing and growth control that extends beyond its canonical housekeeping function in RNA degradation and indicates an avenue for RNA metabolism to function in amino acid signaling into TORC1. eLife assessment This study in budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) presents important findings demonstrating that the exonuclease Xrn1 regulates autophagy in response to methionine deprivation through effects on TORC1. There is solid evidence that the impact of Xrn1 on TORC1 is contingent on its catalytic activity rather than the degradation of any specific category of mRNAs. A major strength is the novel mechanism, in which Xrn1 modulates the nucleotide-binding state of the Gtr1/2 complex.},

doi ={10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.122863},
abstract ={Mitochondria play an essential role in various biochemical processes that maintain cellular homeostasis. Minor defects in the mitochondrial genome can lead to aversive behavioral responses in an organism. Nevertheless, little is known about the impact of mitochondrial mutations on the metabolome of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). In this study, an untargeted metabolomics approach was employed to elucidate the metabolic aberrant caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations in C. elegans. Specifically, three mutant strains of C. elegans, including clk-1, mev-1, and phb-2, were adopted to study corresponding metabolic signatures. Adult worms were collected, and metabolites were extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Uni-and multivariate analyses were performed to elucidate perturbed metabolism between wildtype worms and mutant strains, and metabolic differences among the mutants. The tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, amino acids, and sugars were significantly affected in the mitochondrial mutants. Overall, each mitochondrial DNA mutation exhibited a different pattern of metabolic alterations. The shift of metabolome appeared to be associated with the lifespan of C. elegans. In particular, clk-1 and mev-1 strains, which had the opposite phenotypes of lifespan, had apparently different metabolomes. Our findings set light on the metabolic consequences of mitochondrial genetic variants, which may help better understand mitochondrial disease mechanisms.},

title ={Evolution of natural lifespan variation and molecular strategies of extended lifespan in yeast},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.64860},
abstract ={To understand the genetic basis and selective forces acting on longevity, it is useful to examine lifespan variation among closely related species, or ecologically diverse isolates of the same species, within a controlled environment. In particular, this approach may lead to understanding mechanisms underlying natural variation in lifespan. Here, we analyzed 76 ecologically diverse wild yeast isolates and discovered a wide diversity of replicative lifespan (RLS). Phylogenetic analyses pointed to genes and environmental factors that strongly interact to modulate the observed aging patterns. We then identified genetic networks causally associated with natural variation in RLS across wild yeast isolates, as well as genes, metabolites, and pathways, many of which have never been associated with yeast lifespan in laboratory settings. In addition, a combined analysis of lifespanassociated metabolic and transcriptomic changes revealed unique adaptations to interconnected amino acid biosynthesis, glutamate metabolism, and mitochondrial function in long-lived strains. Overall, our multiomic and lifespan analyses across diverse isolates of the same species shows how gene-environment interactions shape cellular processes involved in phenotypic variation such as lifespan.},

abstract ={Posttranslational mechanisms play a key role in modifying the abundance and function of cellular proteins. Among these, modification by advanced glycation end products has been shown to accumulate during aging and age-associated diseases but specific protein targets and functional consequences remain largely unexplored. Here, we devise a proteomic strategy to identify sites of carboxymethyllysine modification, one of the most abundant advanced glycation end products. We identify over 1000 sites of protein carboxymethylation in mouse and primary human cells treated with the glycating agent glyoxal. By using quantitative proteomics, we find that protein glycation triggers a proteotoxic response and indirectly affects the protein degradation machinery. In primary endothelial cells, we show that glyoxal induces cell cycle perturbation and that carboxymethyllysine modification reduces acetylation of tubulins and impairs microtubule dynamics. Our data demonstrate the relevance of carboxymethyllysine modification for cellular function and pinpoint specific protein networks that might become compromised during aging.},

abstract ={C. elegans SET-9 and SET-26 are highly homologous paralogs that share redundant functions in germline development, but SET-26 alone plays a key role in longevity and heat stress response. Whereas SET-26 is broadly expressed, SET-9 is only detectable in the germline, which likely accounts for their different biological roles. SET-9 and SET-26 bind to H3K4me3 with adjacent acetylation marks in vitro and in vivo. In the soma, SET-26 acts through DAF-16 to modulate longevity. In the germline, SET-9 and SET-26 restrict H3K4me3 domains around SET-9 and SET-26 binding sites, and regulate the expression of specific target genes, with critical consequence on germline development. SET-9 and SET-26 are highly conserved and our findings provide new insights into the functions of these H3K4me3 readers in germline development and longevity.},

title ={Comparison of lipidome profiles of Caenorhabditis elegans—results from an inter-laboratory ring trial},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1007/s11306-021-01775-6},
abstract ={Introduction Lipidomic profiling allows 100s if not 1000s of lipids in a sample to be detected and quantified. Modern lipidomics techniques are ultra-sensitive assays that enable the discovery of novel biomarkers in a variety of fields and provide new insight in mechanistic investigations. Despite much progress in lipidomics, there remains, as for all high throughput "omics" strategies, the need to develop strategies to standardize and integrate quality control into studies in order to enhance robustness, reproducibility, and usability of studies within specific fields and beyond. Objectives We aimed to understand how much results from lipid profiling in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans are influenced by different culture conditions in different laboratories. Methods In this work we have undertaken an inter-laboratory study, comparing the lipid profiles of N2 wild type C. elegans and daf-2(e1370) mutants lacking a functional insulin receptor. Sample were collected from worms grown in four separate laboratories under standardized growth conditions. We used an UPLC-UHR-ToF-MS system allowing chromatographic separation before MS analysis. Results We found common qualitative changes in several marker lipids in samples from the individual laboratories. On the other hand, even in this controlled experimental system, the exact fold-changes for each marker varied between laboratories. Conclusion Our results thus reveal a serious limitation to the reproducibility of current lipid profiling experiments and reveal challenges to the integration of such data from different laboratories.},

title ={Dietary thiols accelerate aging of C. elegans},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-021-24634-3},
abstract ={Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant cellular antioxidant. As reactive oxygen species (ROS) are widely believed to promote aging and age-related diseases, and antioxidants can neutralize ROS, it follows that GSH and its precursor, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), are among the most popular dietary supplements. However, the long-term effects of GSH or NAC on healthy animals have not been thoroughly investigated. We employed C. elegans to demonstrate that chronic administration of GSH or NAC to young or aged animals perturbs global gene expression, inhibits skn-1-mediated transcription, and accelerates aging. In contrast, limiting the consumption of dietary thiols, including those naturally derived from the microbiota, extended lifespan. Pharmacological GSH restriction activates the unfolded protein response and increases proteotoxic stress resistance in worms and human cells. It is thus advantageous for healthy individuals to avoid excessive dietary antioxidants and, instead, rely on intrinsic GSH biosynthesis, which is fine-tuned to match the cellular redox status and to promote homeostatic ROS signaling.},

year ={2022},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.74812},
abstract ={Histone methylation plays crucial roles in the development, gene regulation, and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency in mammals. Recent work shows that histone methylation is associated with aging, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we identified a class of putative histone 3 lysine 9 mono/dimethyltransferase genes (met-2, set-6, set-19, set-20, set-21, set-32, and set-33), mutations in which induce synergistic lifespan extension in the long-lived DAF-2 (insulin growth factor 1 [IGF-1] receptor) mutant in Caenorhabditis elegans. These putative histone methyltransferase plus daf-2 double mutants not only exhibited an average lifespan nearly three times that of wild-type animals and a maximal lifespan of approximately 100 days, but also significantly increased resistance to oxidative and heat stress. Synergistic lifespan extension depends on the transcription factor DAF-16 (FOXO). mRNA-seq experiments revealed that the mRNA levels of DAF-16 Class I genes, which are activated by DAF-16, were further elevated in the daf-2;set double mutants. Among these genes, tts-1, F35E8.7, ins-35, nhr-62, sod-3, asm-2, and Y39G8B.7 are required for the lifespan extension of the daf-2;set-21 double mutant. In addition, treating daf-2 animals with the H3K9me1/2 methyltransferase G9a inhibitor also extends lifespan and increases stress resistance. Therefore, investigation of DAF-2 and H3K9me1/2 deficiency-mediated synergistic longevity will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aging and therapeutic applications.},

abstract ={Lysosomes are key cellular organelles that metabolize extra-and intracellular substrates. Alterations in lysosomal metabolism are implicated in aging-associated metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. However, how lysosomal metabolism actively coordinates the metabolic and nervous systems to regulate aging remains unclear. Here, we report a fat-toneuron lipid signaling pathway induced by lysosomal metabolism and its longevity promoting role in Caenorhabditis elegans. We discovered that lysosomal lipolysis in peripheral fat storage tissue up-regulates the neuropeptide signaling pathway in the nervous system to promote longevity. This cell-non-autonomous regulation requires the secretion from the fat storage tissue of a lipid chaperone protein LBP-3 and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). LBP-3 binds to specific PUFAs, and acts through a nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49 and neuropeptide NLP-11 in neurons to extend lifespan. Together, these results reveal lysosomes as a signaling hub to coordinate metabolism and aging, and a lysosomal signaling mechanism that mediates intertissue communication to promote longevity.},

year ={2021},
doi ={10.1371/journal.pgen.1009358},
abstract ={The feeling of hunger or satiety results from integration of the sensory nervous system with other physiological and metabolic cues. This regulates food intake, maintains homeostasis and prevents disease. In C. elegans, chemosensory neurons sense food and relay information to the rest of the animal via hormones to control food-related behaviour and physiology. Here we identify a new component of this system, SKN-1B which acts as a central foodresponsive node, ultimately controlling satiety and metabolic homeostasis. SKN-1B, an ortholog of mammalian NF-E2 related transcription factors (Nrfs), has previously been implicated with metabolism, respiration and the increased lifespan incurred by dietary restriction. Here we show that SKN-1B acts in two hypothalamus-like ASI neurons to sense food, communicate nutritional status to the organism, and control satiety and exploratory behaviours. This is achieved by SKN-1B modulating endocrine signalling pathways (IIS and TGF-β), and by promoting a robust mitochondrial network. Our data suggest a food-sensing and satiety role for mammalian Nrf proteins.},

Here we generated the transcriptomic Cell Atlas of Worm Aging (CAWA, http://mengwanglab. org/atlas) of wild-type and long-lived strains. We discovered cell-specific, age-related molecular and functional signatures across all somatic and germ cell types. We developed transcriptomic aging clocks for different tissues and quantitatively determined how three different pro-longevity strategies slow tissue aging distinctively. Furthermore, through genome-wide profiling of alternative polyadenylation (APA) events in different tissues, we discovered cell-type-specific APA changes during aging and revealed how these changes are differentially affected by the pro-longevity strategies. Together, this study offers fundamental molecular insights into both somatic and reproductive aging and provides a valuable resource for in-depth understanding of the diversity of pro-longevity mechanisms.},

title ={Dietary restriction extends lifespan across different temperatures in the fly},
year ={2023},
doi ={10.1101/2023.10.13.562222},
abstract ={Dietary restriction (DR) has been consistently shown to extend lifespan across a range of taxa. However, it has recently been reported that DR does not extend lifespan at certain, namely lower, temperatures in flies (Drosophila melanogaster). Similar to the interpretation of other findings that appear to question DR's universality, this finding has been interpreted as being an artefact of benign laboratory conditions. Here we re-test this hypothesis, now using a strain that shows robust lifespan extension at 25°C (across three prior experiments), and using a range of 5 diets across two temperatures, 18°C and 21°C. We found the DR longevity response to be robust, extending lifespan irrespective of temperature. We measured fecundity as a positive control for the DR phenotype, and found, as predicted, that DR reduces egg laying. It will be important for results that question DR as a phenotype to not be overinterpreted readily, as with a substantially larger sample size and a larger range of diets we were unable to replicate this prior work. Differences in experimental setup, genetic lines used and variation in the diet-lifespan reaction norm we suggest are responsible for this discrepancy.

title ={Reduced ech-6 expression attenuates fat-induced lifespan shortening in C. elegans},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.1038/s41598-022-07397-9},
abstract ={Deregulated energy homeostasis represents a hallmark of aging and results from complex geneby-environment interactions. Here, we discovered that reducing the expression of the gene ech-6 encoding enoyl-CoA hydratase remitted fat diet-induced deleterious effects on lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans, while a basal expression of ech-6 was important for survival under normal dietary conditions. Lipidomics revealed that supplementation of fat in ech-6-silenced worms had marginal effects on lipid profiles, suggesting an alternative fat utilization for energy production. Transcriptomics further suggest a causal relation between the lysosomal pathway, energy production, and the longevity effect conferred by the interaction between ech-6 and fat diets. Indeed, enhancing energy production from endogenous fat by overexpressing lysosomal lipase lipl-4 recapitulated the lifespan effects of fat diets on ech-6-silenced worms. Collectively, these results suggest that the gene ech-6 is potential modulator of metabolic flexibility and may be a target for promoting metabolic health and longevity.},

title ={Modular Evolution of the <i>Drosophila</i> Metabolome},
year ={2021},
doi ={10.1093/molbev/msab307},
abstract ={Comparative phylogenetic studies offer a powerful approach to study the evolution of complex traits. Although much effort has been devoted to the evolution of the genome and to organismal phenotypes, until now relatively little work has been done on the evolution of the metabolome, despite the fact that it is composed of the basic structural and functional building blocks of all organisms. Here we explore variation in metabolite levels across 50 My of evolution in the genus Drosophila, employing a common garden design to measure the metabolome within and among 11 species of Drosophila. We find that both sex and age have dramatic and evolutionarily conserved effects on the metabolome. We also find substantial evidence that many metabolite pairs covary after phylogenetic correction, and that such metabolome coevolution is modular. Some of these modules are enriched for specific biochemical pathways and show different evolutionary trajectories, with some showing signs of stabilizing selection. Both observations suggest that functional relationships may ultimately cause such modularity. These coevolutionary patterns also differ between sexes and are affected by age. We explore the relevance of modular evolution to fitness by associating modules with lifespan variation measured in the same common garden. We find several modules associated with lifespan, particularly in the metabolome of older flies. Oxaloacetate levels in older females appear to coevolve with lifespan, and a lifespan-associated module in older females suggests that metabolic associations could underlie 50 My of lifespan evolution.},

year ={2020},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.58815},
abstract ={The relationship between lipid metabolism and longevity remains unclear. Although fat oxidation is essential for weight loss, whether it remains beneficial when sustained for long periods, and the extent to which it may attenuate or augment lifespan remain important unanswered questions. Here, we develop an experimental handle in the Caenorhabditis elegans model system, in which we uncover the mechanisms that connect long-term fat oxidation with longevity. We find that sustained b-oxidation via activation of the conserved triglyceride lipase ATGL-1, triggers a feedback transcriptional loop that involves the mito-nuclear transcription factor ATFS-1, and a previously unknown and highly conserved repressor of ATGL-1 called HLH-11/AP4. This feedback loop orchestrates the dual control of fat oxidation and lifespan, and shields the organism from lifeshortening mitochondrial stress in the face of continuous fat oxidation. Thus, we uncover one mechanism by which fat oxidation can be sustained for long periods without deleterious effects on longevity.},

title ={Disrupted liver oxidative metabolism in glycine N-methyltransferase-deficient mice is mitigated by dietary methionine restriction},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.1016/j.molmet.2022.101452},
abstract ={Objective: One-carbon metabolism is routinely dysregulated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This includes decreased glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), a critical regulator of s-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Deletion of GNMT in mice increases SAM and promotes liver steatosis. Lower liver oxidative metabolism, as indicated by a decline in gluconeogenesis, citric acid cycle flux, and oxidative phosphorylation contributes to liver steatosis in GNMT-null mice; however, the extent to which higher SAM mediates this phenotype remains unclear. Here, we determined the SAM-dependent impairment in liver oxidative metabolism by loss of GNMT. Methods: GNMT knockout (KO) mice were fed a methionine-restricted diet to prevent increased SAM. 2 H/ 13 C metabolic flux analysis was performed in conscious, unrestrained mice to quantify liver nutrient fluxes. Metabolomics and high-resolution respirometry were used to quantify liver nutrient pool sizes and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, respectively. Folic acid-supplemented and serine/glycine-deficient diets were used independently to further define the metabolic implications of perturbed one-carbon donor availability. Results: Dietary methionine restriction prevented a 75-fold increase in SAM and a 53% rise in triacylglycerides in livers of KO mice. Dietary methionine restriction increased gluconeogenesis, independent of genotype, and restored cytochrome c oxidase respiratory function in KO mice. Citric acid cycle fluxes remained lower in KO mice irrespective of diet. Restricting dietary methionine abrogated markers of increased lipogenesis and folate cycle dysfunction in KO mice. Conclusions: The impaired liver oxidative metabolism following loss of GNMT is both dependent and independent of greater SAM availability. Lower in vivo citric acid cycle flux is independent of increased SAM. In contrast, gluconeogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation are negatively regulated by excess SAM. Lipid accumulation in livers of mice lacking GNMT is also linked to higher SAM.},

year ={2024},
doi ={10.1016/j.isci.2024.109789},
abstract ={Mitochondrial function relies on the coordinated transcription of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes to assemble respiratory chain complexes. Across species, the SIN3 coregulator influences mitochondrial functions, but how its loss impacts mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolism in the context of a whole organism is unknown. Exploring this link is important because SIN3 haploinsufficiency causes intellectual disability/autism syndromes and SIN3 plays a role in tumor biology. Here we show that loss of C. elegans SIN-3 results in transcriptional deregulation of mitochondrial-and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, potentially leading to mito-nuclear imbalance. Consistent with impaired mitochondrial function, sin-3 mutants show extensive mitochondrial fragmentation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in vivo imaging, and altered oxygen consumption. Metabolomic analysis of sin-3 mutant animals revealed a mitochondria stress signature and deregulation of methionine flux, resulting in decreased S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and increased polyamine levels. Our results identify SIN3 as a key regulator of mitochondrial dynamics and metabolic flux, with important implications for human pathologies.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1038/s41467-023-36181-0},
abstract ={Flavin containing monooxygenases (FMOs) are promiscuous enzymes known for metabolizing a wide range of exogenous compounds. In C. elegans, fmo-2 expression increases lifespan and healthspan downstream of multiple longevity-promoting pathways through an unknown mechanism. Here, we report that, beyond its classification as a xenobiotic enzyme, fmo-2 expression leads to rewiring of endogenous metabolism principally through changes in one carbon metabolism (OCM). These changes are likely relevant, as we find that genetically modifying OCM enzyme expression leads to alterations in longevity that interact with fmo-2 expression. Using computer modeling, we identify decreased methylation as the major OCM flux modified by FMO-2 that is sufficient to recapitulate its longevity benefits. We further find that tryptophan is decreased in multiple mammalian FMO overexpression models and is a validated substrate for FMO-2. Our resulting model connects a single enzyme to two previously unconnected key metabolic pathways and provides a framework for the metabolic interconnectivity of longevity-promoting pathways such as dietary restriction. FMOs are well-conserved enzymes that are also induced by lifespan-extending interventions in mice, supporting a conserved and important role in promoting health and longevity through metabolic remodeling.},

year ={2023},
doi ={10.1093/g3journal/jkad029},
abstract ={Abnormal nuclear morphology is suggested to be a hallmark of aging and one such abnormality is nuclear blebbing. However, little is known about whether and how nuclear blebbing participates in animal aging, and what regulates it. In this study, we show that the frequency of nuclear blebbing in the hypodermis increases during aging in wild-type C. elegans. These nuclear blebs are enveloped by the nuclear lamina, the inner and the outer nuclear membrane, and 42% of them contain chromatin. Although nuclear blebbing could lead to DNA loss if chromatin-containing blebs detach and fuse with lysosomes, we find by time-lapse imaging that nuclear blebs rarely detach, and the estimated lifetime of a nuclear bleb is 772 h or 32 days. The amount of DNA lost through nuclear blebbing is estimated to be about 0.1% of the total DNA loss by adult Day 11. Furthermore, the frequency of nuclear blebbing does not correlate with the rate of aging in C. elegans. Old age does not necessarily induce nuclear blebbing, neither does starvation, heat stress, or oxidative stress. Intriguingly, we find that proliferation of germ cells promotes nuclear blebbing.},

title ={An acetylation-mediated chromatin switch governs H3K4 methylation readwrite capability},
year ={2022},
doi ={10.7554/eLife.82596},
abstract ={In nucleosomes, histone N-terminal tails exist in dynamic equilibrium between free/ accessible and collapsed/DNA-bound states. The latter state is expected to impact histone N-termini availability to the epigenetic machinery. Notably, H3 tail acetylation (e.g. K9ac, K14ac, K18ac) is linked to increased H3K4me3 engagement by the BPTF PHD finger, but it is unknown if this mechanism has a broader extension. Here, we show that H3 tail acetylation promotes nucleosomal accessibility to other H3K4 methyl readers, and importantly, extends to H3K4 writers, notably methyltransferase MLL1. This regulation is not observed on peptide substrates yet occurs on the cis H3 tail, as determined with fully-defined heterotypic nucleosomes. In vivo, H3 tail acetylation is directly and dynamically coupled with cis H3K4 methylation levels. Together, these observations reveal an acetylation 'chromatin switch' on the H3 tail that modulates read-write accessibility in nucleosomes and resolves the long-standing question of why H3K4me3 levels are coupled with H3 acetylation. Editor's evaluation This is a fundamental study revealing that cis H3 tail acetylation promotes nucleosome accessibility to histone methyl readers and writers. The findings are supported by compelling evidence providing an explanation for long-observed mechanisms of chromatin crosstalk.},

title ={N6-adenosine methylation of ribosomal RNA affects lipid oxidation and stress resistance},
year ={},
doi ={},
abstract ={During stress, global translation is reduced, but specific transcripts are actively translated. How stress-responsive mRNAs are selectively translated is unknown. We show that METL-5 methylates adenosine 1717 on 18S ribosomal RNA in C. elegans, enhancing selective ribosomal binding and translation of specific mRNAs. One of these mRNAs, CYP-29A3, oxidizes the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid to eicosanoids, key stress signaling molecules. While metl-5-deficient animals grow normally under homeostatic conditions, they are resistant to a variety of stresses. metl-5 mutant worms also show reduced bioactive lipid eicosanoids and dietary supplementation of eicosanoid products of CYP-29A3 restores stress sensitivity of metl-5 mutant worms. Thus, methylation of a specific residue of 18S rRNA by METL-5 selectively enhances translation of cyp-29A3 to increase production of eicosanoids, and blocking this pathway increases stress resistance. This study suggests that ribosome methylation can facilitate selective translation, providing another layer of regulation of the stress response.},
